            "Text for extraction: Specific human gene expression in response to infection is an effective marker for diagnosis of latent and active tuberculosis <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>RNA sequencing and microarray analysis revealed transcriptional markers expressed in whole blood can differentiate active pulmonary TB (ATB) from other respiratory diseases (ORDs), and latent TB infection (LTBI) from healthy controls (HC). Here we describe a streamlined reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay that could be applied at near point-of-care for diagnosing and distinguishing ATB from ORDs and LTBI from HC. A literature review was undertaken to identify the most plausible host-gene markers (HGM) of TB infection. Primers, and dual labelled hydrolysis probes were designed and analytically evaluated for accuracy in an in-vitro model of infection using a lung fibroblast cell-line. Best performing genes were multiplexed into panels of 2–4 targets and taken forward for clinical evaluation. Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube and QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus were used as reference tests for ATB and LTBI respectively. A total of 16 HGM were selected and incorporated into five multiplex RT-qPCR panels. PCR assay efficiency of all evaluated targets was ≥ 90% with a median analytical sensitivity of 292 copies/µl [IQR: 215.0-358.3 copies/µl], and a median limit of quantification of 61.7 copies/µl [IQR: 29.4-176.3 copies/µl]. Clinically, ATB was characterised by higher gene expression than ORDs, while LTBI was associated with lower gene expression than HC, Kruskal-Wallis p &lt; 0.0001. Crucially, BATF2, CD64, GBP5, C1QB, GBP6, DUSP3, and GAS6 exhibited high differentiative ability for ATB from ORDs, LTBI or HC while KLF2, PTPRC, NEMF, ASUN, and ZNF296 independently discriminated LTBI from HC. Our results show that different HGM maybe required for ATB and LTBI differentiation from ORDs or HC respectively and demonstrate the feasibility of host gene-based RT-qPCR to diagnose ATB and LTBI at near point-of-care.</jats:p>\n",

This remarkable increase in cytokines and other inflammatory molecules is primarily caused by viral proteins, and particular interest has been given to ORF8, a unique accessory protein specific to SARS-CoV-2. Despite plenty of research, the precise mechanisms by which ORF8 induces proinflammatory cytokines are not clear. Our investigations demonstrated that ORF8 augments production of IL-6 induced by Poly(I:C) in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mono-DCs). We discuss our findings and the multifaceted roles of ORF8 as a modulator of cytokine response, focusing on type I interferon and IL-6, a key component of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we explore the hypothesis that ORF8 may act through pattern recognition receptors of dsRNA such as TLRs.</jats:p>\n",

This remarkable increase in cytokines and other inflammatory molecules is primary caused by viral proteins, in particular ORF8, a unique accessory protein specific to SARS-CoV-2. In addition to its role in cytokine induction, ORF8 is attributed with various other functions, including its ability to evade type I interferon responses. Despite the evidence, the mechanisms through which ORF8 exerts these functions remains a subject of controversy. In this mini review, we discuss the multifaceted roles of ORF8 as a modulator of cytokine response, focusing on type I interferon and IL-6.

            "Text for extraction: Molecular modelling of the HCMV IL-10 protein isoforms and analysis of their interaction with the human IL-10 receptor <jats:p>The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL111A gene encodes several homologs of the cellular interleukin 10 (cIL-10). Alternative splicing in the UL111A region produces two relatively well-characterized transcripts designated cmvIL-10 (isoform A) and LAcmvIL-10 (isoform B). The cmvIL-10 protein is the best characterized, both structurally and functionally, and has many immunosuppressive activities similar to cIL-10, while LAcmvIL-10 has more restricted biological activities. Alternative splicing also results in five less studied UL111A transcripts encoding additional proteins homologous to cIL-10 (isoforms C to G). These transcripts were identified during productive HCMV infection of MRC-5 cells with the high passage laboratory adapted AD169 strain, and the structure and properties of the corresponding proteins are largely unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether these protein isoforms are able to bind the cellular IL-10 receptor and induce signalling. In the present study, we investigated the expression spectrum of UL111A transcripts in fully permissive MRC-5 cells and semi permissive U251 cells infected with the low passage HCMV strain TB40E. We identified a new spliced transcript (H) expressed during productive infection. Using computational methods, we carried out molecular modelling studies on the three-dimensional structures of the HCMV IL-10 proteins encoded by the transcripts detected in our work (cmvIL-10 (A), LAcmvIL-10 (B), E, F and H) and on their interaction with the human IL-10 receptor (IL-10R1). The modelling predicts clear differences between the isoform structures. Furthermore, the <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic> simulations (molecular dynamics simulation and normal-mode analyses) allowed us to evaluate regions that contain potential receptor binding sites in each isoform. The analyses demonstrate that the complexes between the isoforms and IL-10R1 present different types of molecular interactions and consequently different affinities and stabilities. The knowledge about structure and expression of specific viral IL-10 isoforms has implications for understanding of their properties and role in HCMV immune evasion and pathogenesis.</jats:p>\n",

The 72-kDa immediate-early protein 1 (IE1) is considered the principal antagonist of PML bodies encoded by the human cytomegalovirus, one of eight human herpesviruses. Previous work has suggested that the interaction between IE1 and PML proteins, the central organisers of PML bodies, and the subsequent disruption of these organelles serve a critical role in viral replication by counteracting intrinsic antiviral immunity and the induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes. However, this picture has emerged largely from studying mutant IE1 proteins known or predicted to be globally misfolded und metabolically unstable. We systematically screened for stable IE1 mutants by clustered charge-to-alanine scanning. We identified a mutant protein (IE1cc172-176) selectively defective for PML interaction. Functional comparisons between the mutant and wild-type protein revealed that IE1 can undergo modification by mixed polymeric SUMO chains and that it targets PML and Sp100, the two main constituents of PML bodies, via distinct mechanisms. Unexpectedly, IE1cc172-176 supported viral replication almost as efficiently as wild-type IE1. Moreover, lower instead of higher (as expected) levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-lambda and IFN-stimulated gene expression were observed with the mutant compared to the wild-type protein and virus. These results suggest that the disruption of PML bodies is linked to induction rather than inhibition of antiviral gene expression. Our findings challenge current views regarding the role of PML bodies in viral infection.</jats:p>\n",

To understand this enigma, we investigate the cross talk between PML-NB components and viral RCs to find the missing link connecting both compartments to promote efficient viral replication and gene expression. Taken together, the current concept is more intricate than originally believed, since viruses apparently take advantage of several specific PML-NB-associated proteins to promote productive infection. Simultaneously, they efficiently inhibit antiviral measures to maintain the viral infectious program. Our data provide evidence that SUMOylation of the viral RC marker protein E2A represents the basis of this virus-host interface and regulates various downstream events to support HAdV productive infection. These results are the basis of our current attempts to generate and screen for specific E2A SUMOylation inhibitors to constitute novel therapeutic approaches to limit and prevent HAdV-mediated diseases and mortality of immunosuppressed patients.</jats:p>\n",

            "Text for extraction: Bright and Early: Inhibiting Human Cytomegalovirus by Targeting Major Immediate-Early Gene Expression or Protein Function <jats:p>The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), one of eight human herpesviruses, establishes lifelong latent infections in most people worldwide. Primary or reactivated HCMV infections cause severe disease in immunosuppressed patients and congenital defects in children. There is no vaccine for HCMV, and the currently approved antivirals come with major limitations. Most approved HCMV antivirals target late molecular processes in the viral replication cycle including DNA replication and packaging. “Bright and early” events in HCMV infection have not been exploited for systemic prevention or treatment of disease. Initiation of HCMV replication depends on transcription from the viral major immediate-early (IE) gene. Alternative transcripts produced from this gene give rise to the IE1 and IE2 families of viral proteins, which localize to the host cell nucleus. The IE1 and IE2 proteins are believed to control all subsequent early and late events in HCMV replication, including reactivation from latency, in part by antagonizing intrinsic and innate immune responses. Here we provide an update on the regulation of major IE gene expression and the functions of IE1 and IE2 proteins. We will relate this insight to experimental approaches that target IE gene expression or protein function via molecular gene silencing and editing or small chemical inhibitors.</jats:p>\n",

            "Text for extraction: Human cytomegalovirus pUL83 targets core histones to inhibit interferon synthesis and promote viral spread <jats:p>Tegument protein pUL83 is the most abundant component of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) particles. The viral protein is predicted to be composed of three domains: a pyrin association domain (PAD), a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD), and an intrinsically disordered linker domain (amino acids 388–479) located between the PAD and CTD. Although pUL83 has been shown to antagonize interferon (IFN) responses, it has not been fully elucidated how the viral protein may contribute to hCMV replication. In this study we demonstrate that pUL83 associates broadly with viral and host chromatin including condensed chromosomes during mitosis. We further show that the linker domain in pUL83 is both required and sufficient for host chromatin targeting, and that this interaction depends on two evolutionary conserved arginine residues (R453 and R455) in the viral protein. Our data indicate that the pUL83 linker domain specifically associates with human core histones (but not linker histones). Furthermore, pUL83 inhibits IFN-beta and IFN-lambda gene induction, but not expression of other cytokine genes, via a mechanism that largely depends on the linker domain including R453/455. Although earlier studies suggested that pUL83 is dispensable for productive hCMV infection in fibroblasts, we find that the viral protein is necessary for efficient plaque formation in these cells, specifically in the presence of IFN. Finally, the pUL83 linker domain including R453/455 contributes significantly to the plaque size in hCMV-infected fibroblasts. Overall, we propose that pUL83 promotes spread of hCMV by selectively inhibiting induction of IFN gene expression via a novel chromatin-based molecular mechanism involving core histones.</jats:p>\n",

A hallmark of all herpesviruses is their biphasic life cycle—viral latency and the productive lytic cycle—and it is well established that reactivation of the KSHV lytic cycle is associated with KS pathogenesis. Therefore, a thorough appreciation of the mechanisms that govern reactivation is required to better understand disease progression. The viral protein replication and transcription activator (RTA) is the KSHV lytic switch protein due to its ability to drive the expression of various lytic genes, leading to reactivation of the entire lytic cycle. While the mechanisms for activating lytic gene expression have received much attention, how RTA impacts cellular function is less well understood. To address this, we developed a cell line with doxycycline-inducible RTA expression and applied stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics. Using this methodology, we have identified a novel cellular protein (AT-rich interacting domain containing 3B [ARID3B]) whose expression was enhanced by RTA and that relocalized to replication compartments upon lytic reactivation. We also show that small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or overexpression of ARID3B led to an enhancement or inhibition of lytic reactivation, respectively. Furthermore, DNA affinity and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that ARID3B specifically interacts with A/T-rich elements in the KSHV origin of lytic replication (oriLyt), and this was dependent on lytic cycle reactivation. Therefore, we have identified a novel cellular protein whose expression is enhanced by KSHV RTA with the ability to inhibit KSHV reactivation.</jats:p>\n",

Importantly, however, reactivation of productive viral replication (the lytic cycle) is necessary for the pathogenesis of KS. Therefore, it is important that we comprehensively understand the mechanisms that govern lytic reactivation, to better understand disease progression. In this study, we have identified a novel cellular protein (AT-rich interacting domain protein 3B [ARID3B]) that we show is able to temper lytic reactivation. We showed that the master lytic switch protein, RTA, enhanced ARID3B levels, which then interacted with viral DNA in a lytic cycle-dependent manner. Therefore, we have added a new factor to the list of cellular proteins that regulate the KSHV lytic cycle, which has implications for our understanding of KSHV biology.\n",

            "          <jats:p>The 72-kDa immediate early 1 (IE1) protein encoded by human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) is a nuclearly localized promiscuous regulator of viral and cellular transcription. IE1 has long been known to associate with host mitotic chromatin, yet the mechanisms underlying this interaction have not been specified. In this study, we identify the cellular chromosome receptor for IE1. We demonstrate that the viral protein targets human nucleosomes by directly binding to core histones in a nucleic acid-independent manner. IE1 exhibits two separable histone-interacting regions with differential binding specificities for H2A-H2B and H3-H4. The H2A-H2B binding region was mapped to an evolutionarily conserved 10-amino-acid motif within the chromatin-tethering domain (CTD) of IE1. Results from experimental approaches combined with molecular modeling indicate that the IE1 CTD adopts a β-hairpin structure, docking with the acidic pocket formed by H2A-H2B on the nucleosome surface. IE1 binds to the acidic pocket in a way similar to that of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Consequently, the IE1 and LANA CTDs compete for binding to nucleosome cores and chromatin. Our work elucidates in detail how a key viral regulator is anchored to human chromosomes and identifies the nucleosomal acidic pocket as a joint target of proteins from distantly related viruses. Based on the striking similarities between the IE1 and LANA CTDs and the fact that nucleosome targeting by IE1 is dispensable for productive replication even in “clinical” strains of hCMV, we speculate that the two viral proteins may serve analogous functions during latency of their respective viruses.</jats:p>\n",

            "Text for extraction: Nucleosome maps of the human cytomegalovirus genome reveal a temporal switch in chromatin organization linked to a major IE protein <jats:p>Human CMV (hCMV) establishes lifelong infections in most of us, causing developmental defects in human embryos and life-threatening disease in immunocompromised individuals. During productive infection, the viral &gt;230,000-bp dsDNA genome is expressed widely and in a temporal cascade. The hCMV genome does not carry histones when encapsidated but has been proposed to form nucleosomes after release into the host cell nucleus. Here, we present hCMV genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and nascent transcript maps during infection of permissive human primary cells. We show that nucleosomes occupy nuclear viral DNA in a nonrandom and highly predictable fashion. At early times of infection, nucleosomes associate with the hCMV genome largely according to their intrinsic DNA sequence preferences, indicating that initial nucleosome formation is genetically encoded in the virus. However, as infection proceeds to the late phase, nucleosomes redistribute extensively to establish patterns mostly determined by nongenetic factors. We propose that these factors include key regulators of viral gene expression encoded at the hCMV major immediate-early (IE) locus. Indeed, mutant virus genomes deficient for IE1 expression exhibit globally increased nucleosome loads and reduced nucleosome dynamics compared with WT genomes. The temporal nucleosome occupancy differences between IE1-deficient and WT viruses correlate inversely with changes in the pattern of viral nascent and total transcript accumulation. These results provide a framework of spatial and temporal nucleosome organization across the genome of a major human pathogen and suggest that an hCMV major IE protein governs overall viral chromatin structure and function.</jats:p>\n",

            "          <jats:p>In the nuclei of permissive cells, human cytomegalovirus genomes form nucleosomal structures initially resembling heterochromatin but gradually switching to a euchromatin-like state. This switch is characterized by a decrease in histone H3 K9 methylation and a marked increase in H3 tail acetylation and H3 K4 methylation across the viral genome. We used ganciclovir and a mutant virus encoding a reversibly destabilized DNA polymerase to examine the impact of DNA replication on histone modification dynamics at the viral chromatin. The changes in H3 tail acetylation and H3 K9 methylation proceeded in a DNA replication-independent fashion. In contrast, the increase in H3 K4 methylation proved to depend widely on viral DNA synthesis. Consistently, labeling of nascent DNA using “click chemistry” revealed preferential incorporation of methylated H3 K4 into viral (but not cellular) chromatin during or following DNA replication. This study demonstrates largely selective epigenetic tagging of postreplicative human cytomegalovirus chromatin.</jats:p>\n",

During infection, the large double‐stranded DNA genomes of all herpesviruses are transcribed, replicated and encapsidated in the host cell nucleus, where DNA is typically structured and manoeuvred through nucleosomes. Nucleosomes individually assemble DNA around core histone octamers to form ‘beads‐on‐a‐string’ chromatin fibres. Herpesviruses have responded to the advantages and challenges of chromatin formation in biologically unique ways. Although herpesvirus DNA is devoid of histones within nucleocapsids, nuclear viral genomes most likely form irregularly arranged or unstable nucleosomes during productive infection, and regular nucleosomal arrays resembling host cell chromatin in latently infected cells. Besides variations in nucleosome density, herpesvirus chromatin ‘bead strings’ undergo dynamic changes in histone composition and modification during the different stages of productive replication, latent infection and reactivation from latency, raising the likely possibility that epigenetic processes may dictate, at least in part, the outcome of infection and ensuing pathogenesis. Here, we summarise and discuss several new and important aspects regarding the nucleosome‐based mechanisms that regulate herpesvirus chromatin structure and function in infected cells. Special emphasis is given to processes of histone deposition, histone variant exchange and covalent histone modification in relation to the transcription from the viral genome during productive and latent infections by human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus type 1. We also present an overview on emerging histone‐directed antiviral strategies that may be developed into ‘epigenetic therapies’ to improve current prevention and treatment options targeting herpesvirus infection and disease.

When encapsidated in virus particles, the viral DNA is devoid of any nucleosomes. In contrast, within latently infected nuclei herpesvirus genomes are believed to form regular nucleosomal structures resembling cellular chromatin. Finally, during productive infection nuclear viral DNA appears to adopt a state of intermediate chromatin formation with irregularly spaced nucleosomes. Nucleosome occupancy coupled with posttranslational histone modifications and other epigenetic marks may contribute significantly to the extent and timing of transcription from the viral genome and, consequently, to the outcome of infection. Recent research has provided first insights into the viral and cellular mechanisms that either maintain individual herpesvirus chromatin states or mediate transition between them. Here, we summarise and discuss both early work and new developments pointing towards common principles pertinent to the dynamic structure and epigenetic regulation of herpesvirus chromatin. Special emphasis is given to the emerging similarities in nucleosome assembly and disassembly processes on herpes simplex virus type 1 and human cytomegalovirus genomes over the course of the viral productive replication cycle and during the switch between latent and lytic infectious stages.

It has been suggested that IE1 inhibits interferon signaling through intranuclear sequestration of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) protein. Here we show that physical association and subnuclear colocalization of IE1 and STAT2 depend on short acidic and serine/proline-rich low-complexity motifs in the carboxy-terminal region of the 491-amino-acid viral polypeptide. These motifs compose an essential core (amino acids 373 to 420) and an adjacent ancillary site (amino acids 421 to 445) for STAT2 interaction that are predicted to form part of a natively unstructured domain. The presence of presumably “disordered” carboxy-terminal domains enriched in low-complexity motifs is evolutionarily highly conserved across all examined mammalian IE1 orthologs, and the murine cytomegalovirus IE1 protein appears to interact with STAT2 just like the human counterpart. A recombinant hCMV specifically mutated in the IE1 core STAT2 binding site displays hypersensitivity to alpha interferon, delayed early viral protein accumulation, and attenuated growth in fibroblasts. However, replication of this mutant virus is specifically restored by knockdown of STAT2 expression. Interestingly, complex formation with STAT2 proved to be entirely separable from disruption of nuclear domain 10 (ND10), another key activity of IE1. Finally, our results demonstrate that IE1 counteracts the antiviral interferon response and promotes viral replication by at least two distinct mechanisms, one depending on sequestration of STAT2 and the other one likely involving ND10 interaction.</jats:p>\n",

The viral DNA lacks histones when encapsidated in the virion. However, it has been found histone associated inside infected cells, implying unidentified chromatin assembly mechanisms. Our results indicate that components of the host cell nucleosome deposition machinery target intranuclear CMV DNA, resulting in stepwise viral-chromatin assembly. CMV genomes undergo limited histone association and nucleosome assembly as early as 30 min after infection via DNA replication-independent mechanisms. Low average viral-genome chromatinization is maintained throughout the early stages of infection. The late phase of infection is characterized by a striking increase in average histone occupancy coupled with the process of viral-DNA replication. While the initial chromatinization affected all analyzed parts of the CMV chromosome, a subset of viral genomic regions, including the major immediate-early promoter, proved to be largely resistant to replication-dependent histone deposition. Finally, our results predict the likely requirement for an unanticipated chromatin disassembly process that enables packaging of histone-free DNA into progeny capsids.</jats:p>\n",

            "            Type I IFNs are crucial components of the innate immune response to viral attack. They are rapidly synthesized and secreted after infection with human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and trigger a signal transduction pathway that involves successive activation and nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. The activated STATs, together with the IFN regulatory factor 9 protein, form a trimeric transcription complex (IFN-stimulated gene factor 3) that stimulates expression of numerous IFN-responsive genes, many of which exhibit antiviral activity. Here we demonstrate that the viral 72-kDa IE1 protein (IE1-72kDa) confers partial resistance to the antiviral activity of type I IFNs upon CMV. Accordingly, IFN-responsive transcripts accumulate to substantially increased levels after infection with an IE1-deficient mutant as compared with wild-type virus, and ectopic expression of the viral protein in stably transfected cells is sufficient to block their induction. We further show that IE1-72kDa forms a physical complex with STAT1 and STAT2 in nuclei of infected cells and\n",

Using an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome clone of human cytomegalovirus, we constructed a mutant virus (BAD<jats:italic>pm</jats:italic>IE1-K450R) that is deficient for SUMOylation of IE1-72kDa due to a single amino acid exchange in the SUMO-1 attachment site. Compared to wild-type virus, this mutant grew more slowly and generated a reduced yield in infected human fibroblasts, indicating that SUMO modification is required for the full activity of IE1-72kDa. The lack of SUMOylation did not affect the intranuclear localization of IE1-72kDa, including its ability to target to and disrupt PML bodies and to bind to mitotic chromatin. Likewise, SUMOylation-deficient IE1-72kDa activated several viral promoters as efficiently as the wild-type protein. However, the failure to modify IE1-72kDa resulted in substantially reduced levels of the IE2 transcript and its 86-kDa protein (IE2-86kDa). These observations suggest that SUMO modification of IE1-72kDa contributes to efficient HCMV replication by promoting the accumulation of IE2-86kDa.</jats:p>\n",

            "          <jats:p>Viruses have evolved various strategies to prevent premature apoptosis of infected host cells. Some of the viral genes mediating antiapoptotic functions have been identified by their homology to cellular genes, but others are structurally unrelated to genes of known function. In this study, we used a random, unbiased approach to identify such genes in the murine cytomegalovirus genome. From a library of random transposon insertion mutants, a mutant virus that caused premature cell death was isolated. The transposon was inserted within open reading frame m41. An independently constructed m41 deletion mutant showed the same phenotype, whereas deletion mutants lacking the adjacent genes m40 and M42 did not. Apoptosis occurred in different cell types, could be blocked by caspase inhibitors, and did not require p53. Within the murine cytomegalovirus genome, m41, m40, and m39 form a small cluster of genes of unknown function. They are homologous to r41, r40, and r39 of rat cytomegalovirus, but lack sequence homology to UL41, UL40, and UL37 exon 1 (UL37x1) which are located at the corresponding positions of the human cytomegalovirus genome. Unlike UL37x1 of human cytomegalovirus, which encodes a mitochondrion-localized inhibitor of apoptosis that is essential for virus replication, m41 encodes a protein that localizes to the Golgi apparatus. The murine cytomegalovirus m41 product is the first example of a Golgi-localized protein that prevents premature apoptosis and thus extends the life span of infected cells.</jats:p>\n",

            "          <jats:p>According to classical concepts of viral oncogenesis, the persistence of virus-specific oncogenes is required to maintain the transformed cellular phenotype. In contrast, the “hit-and-run” hypothesis claims that viruses can mediate cellular transformation through an initial “hit,” while maintenance of the transformed state is compatible with the loss (“run”) of viral molecules. It is well established that the adenovirus E1A and E1B gene products can cooperatively transform primary human and rodent cells to a tumorigenic phenotype and that these cells permanently express the viral oncogenes. Additionally, recent studies have shown that the adenovirus E4 region encodes two novel oncoproteins, the products of E4orf6 and E4orf3, which cooperate with the viral E1A proteins to transform primary rat cells in an E1B-like fashion. Unexpectedly, however, cells transformed by E1A and either E4orf6 or E4orf3 fail to express the viral E4 gene products, and only a subset contain E1A proteins. In fact, the majority of these cells lack E4- and E1A-specific DNA sequences, indicating that transformation occurred through a hit-and-run mechanism. We provide evidence that the unusual transforming activities of the adenoviral oncoproteins may be due to their mutagenic potential. Our results strongly support the possibility that even tumors that lack any detectable virus-specific molecules can be of viral origin, which could have a significant impact on the use of adenoviral vectors for gene therapy.</jats:p>\n",

            "          <jats:p>Previous studies have shown that the adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) E4orf6 gene product displays features of a viral oncoprotein. It initiates focal transformation of primary rat cells in cooperation with Ad5 E1 genes and confers multiple additional transformed properties on E1-expressing cells, including profound morphological alterations and dramatically accelerated tumor growth in nude mice. It has been reported that E4orf6 binds to p53 and, in the presence of the Ad5 E1B-55kDa protein, antagonizes p53 stability by targeting the tumor suppressor protein for active degradation. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive mutant analysis to assign transforming functions of E4orf6 to distinct regions within the viral polypeptide and to analyze a possible correlation between E4orf6-dependent p53 degradation and oncogenesis. Our results show that p53 destabilization maps to multiple regions within both amino- and carboxy-terminal parts of the viral protein and widely cosegregates with E4orf6-dependent acceleration of tumor growth, indicating that both effects are related. In contrast, promotion of focus formation and morphological transformation require only a carboxy-terminal segment of the E4 protein. Thus, these effects are completely independent of p53 stability, but may involve other interactions with the tumor suppressor. Our results demonstrate that at least two distinct activities contribute to the oncogenic potential of Ad5 E4orf6. Although genetically separable, both activities are largely mediated through a novel highly conserved, cysteine-rich motif and a recently described arginine-faced amphipathic alpha helix, which resides within a carboxy-terminal “oncodomain” of the viral protein.</jats:p>\n",
