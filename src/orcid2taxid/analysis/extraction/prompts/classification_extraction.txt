You will be analyzing a scientific paper to classify various aspects of the research. Follow these steps carefully:

1. You will be given the title and abstract of a scientific paper. This content will be enclosed in <scientific_paper> tags.

<scientific_paper>
{{ paper_content }}
</scientific_paper>

2. Based on the content, you need to classify the paper according to the following categories:

{{ classification_description }}

3. Prepare your output in the following format:

<output>
<classification>
{
    "wet_lab_work": "value",
    "bsl_level": "value",
    "dna_use": ["value1", "value2", ...],
    "novel_sequence_experience": "value",
    "dna_type": ["value1", "value2", ...]
}
</classification>

<justification>
[Provide your justification here, explaining the reasoning behind each classification]
</justification>
</output>

4. Guidelines for classification:
- Be conservative in your classifications. If you're unsure, use "undetermined" or "not_specified"
- For lists (dna_use and dna_type), include all applicable values
- Base your classifications on explicit mentions in the text rather than assumptions
- Consider the context and methods described in the paper
- If certain aspects are not mentioned, use the appropriate "not_specified" value
