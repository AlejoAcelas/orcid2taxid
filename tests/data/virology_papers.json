[{"title":"Per aspera ad astra: application of Simplex QSAR approach in antiviral research.","abstract":"This review explores the application of the Simplex representation of molecular structure (SiRMS) QSAR approach in antiviral research. We provide an introduction to and description of SiRMS, its application in antiviral research and future directions of development of the Simplex approach and the whole QSAR field. In the Simplex approach every molecule is represented as a system of different simplexes (tetratomic fragments with fixed composition, structure, chirality and symmetry). The main advantages of SiRMS are consideration of the different physical-chemical properties of atoms, high adequacy and good interpretability of models obtained and clear procedures for molecular design. The reliability of developed QSAR models as predictive virtual screening tools and their ability to serve as the basis of directed drug design was validated by subsequent synthetic and biological experiments. The SiRMS approach is realized as the complex of the computer program 'HiT QSAR', which is available on request.","doi":"10.4155/fmc.10.194","publication_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00","journal_name":"Future medicinal chemistry","journal_issn":"1756-8919","authors":[{"given_name":"Eugene N","family_name":"Muratov","full_name":"Muratov EN","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry, Department of Molecular Structure, A.V.

in Nigeria, 2018.","abstract":"The first nationally representative, population-based study of schistosomiasis seroprevalence in Nigeria was conducted using blood samples and risk-factor data collected during the 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS). Schistosomiasis seroprevalence was estimated by analyzing samples for reactivity to schistosome soluble egg antigen (SEA) in a multiplex bead assay; NAIIS survey data were assessed to identify potential risk factors for seropositivity. The SEA antibody data were available for 31,459 children aged 0 to 14 years. Overall seroprevalence was 17.2% (95% CI: 16.3-18.1%). Seropositive children were identified in every age group, including children < 5 years, and seroprevalence increased with increasing age (P < 0.0001). Several factors were associated with increased odds of seropositivity, including being a boy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.24-1.45), living in a rural area (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.9-2.5), and animal ownership (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.52-1.85). Access to improved sanitation and drinking water sources were associated with decreased odds of seropositivity (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.47-0.58 and OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.47-0.60, respectively) regardless of whether the child lived in a rural (sanitation: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.8; drinking water: aOR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.8) or urban area (sanitation: aOR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.5-0.7; drinking water: aOR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4-0.6), highlighting the importance of these factors for schistosomiasis prevention and control. These results identified additional risk populations (children < 5 years) and a new risk factor (animal ownership) and could be used to monitor the impact of control programs.","doi":"10.4269/ajtmh.23-0219","publication_date":"2023-11-27T00:00:00","journal_name":"The American journal of tropical medicine and

Integrated Serological Surveillance of Neglected Tropical and Other Diseases.","abstract":"Serosurveillance can provide estimates of population-level exposure to infectious pathogens and has been used extensively during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simultaneous, serological testing for multiple pathogens can be done using bead-based immunoassays to add value to disease-specific serosurveys. We conducted a validation of four SARS-CoV-2 antigens-full-length spike protein, two receptor binding domain proteins, and the nucleocapsid protein-on our existing multiplex bead assay (MBA) for enteric diseases, malaria, and vaccine preventable diseases. After determining the optimal conditions for coupling the antigens to microsphere beads, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined on two instruments (Luminex-200 and MAGPIX) when testing singly (monoplex) versus combined (multiplex). Sensitivity was assessed using plasma from 87 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) positive persons collected in March-May of 2020 and ranged from 94.3% to 96.6% for the different testing conditions. Specificity was assessed using 98 plasma specimens collected prior to December 2019 and plasma from 19 rRT-PCR negative persons and ranged from 97.4% to 100%. The positive percent agreement was 93.8% to 97.9% using 48 specimens collected > 21 days post-symptom onset, while the negative percent agreement was ≥ 99% for all antigens. Test performance was similar using monoplex or multiplex testing. Integrating SARS-CoV-2 serology with other diseases of public health interest could add significant value to public health programs that have suffered severe programmatic setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.","doi":"10.4269/ajtmh.22-0078","publication_date":"2022-06-27T00:00:00","journal_name":"The American journal of tropical medicine and

We present a QA framework for a study occurring November 2019 to March 2020 involving 504 assay plates detecting four Plasmodium antigens: pan-Plasmodium aldolase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), P. vivax LDH (PvLDH). Controls on each plate included buffer blank, antigen negative blood, and 4-point positive dilution curve. The blank and negative blood provided consistently low signal for all targets except for pAldolase, which showed variability. Positive curve signals decreased throughout the 5-month study duration but retained a coefficient of variation (CV) of < 5%, with the exception of HRP2 in month 5 (CV of 11%). Regression fittings for inter-plate control signals provided mean and standard deviations (SDs), and of 504 assay plates, 6 (1.2%) violated the acceptable deviation limits and were repeated. For the 40,272 human blood samples assayed in this study, of 161,088 potential data points (each sample × 4 antigens), 160,641 (99.7%) successfully passed quality checks.

is a need for reliable serological assays to determine accurate estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence. Most single target antigen assays have shown some limitations in Africa. To assess the performance of a multi-antigen assay, we evaluated a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay for human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nigeria.<h4>Methods</h4>Validation of the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay was carried out using well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reactive positive (97) and pre-COVID-19 pandemic (86) plasma panels. Cross-reactivity was assessed using pre-COVID-19 pandemic plasma specimens (213) from the 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS).<h4>Results</h4>The overall sensitivity of the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay was 75.3% [95% CI: 65.8%- 82.8%] and specificity was 99.0% [95% CI: 96.8%- 99.7%]. The sensitivity estimate increased to 83.3% [95% CI: 70.4%- 91.3%] for specimens >14 days post-confirmation of diagnosis. However, using the NAIIS pre-pandemic specimens, the false positivity rate was 1.4% (3/213).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results showed overall lower sensitivity and a comparable specificity with the manufacturer's validation. There appears to be less cross-reactivity with NAIIS pre-pandemic COVID-19 specimens using the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay. In-country SARS-CoV-2 serology assay validation can help guide the best choice of assays in Africa.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0266184","publication_date":"2022-04-01T00:00:00","journal_name":"PloS

Italy.","abstract":"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a global health problem, causing an estimated 20 million infections annually. Thus, the management of HEV requires special consideration. In developed countries, hepatitis E is mainly recognized as a foodborne disease (mainly transmitted via undercooked meat consumption) that is generally caused by genotype 3 and 4 circulating in various animals, including pigs and wild boars. The current absence of officially recognized protocols for the analysis of HEV in foods and the lack of awareness of this disease among healthcare workers, together with the high percentage of asymptomatic cases, make HEV infection highly underestimated. Most HEV-3 infections in immunocompetent individuals are self-limited. Nevertheless, the possibility of serious forms of liver disease, especially in patients with co-morbidities, should be considered because it can lead to a fatal outcome. Here, we report a case of fatal hepatitis related to HEV-3 infection in a 67-year-old male patient with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD) and living in a region where a high prevalence and genetic heterogeneity of HEV-3 in wild boar has been recently demonstrated. Our case report describes the interdisciplinary approach used (from the diagnosis to the virus phylogenetic characterization) in order to improve epidemiologic HEV surveillance in central Italy.","doi":"10.3390/v16121869","publication_date":"2024-11-30T00:00:00","journal_name":"Viruses","journal_issn":"1999-4915","authors":[{"given_name":"Monica","family_name":"Borghi","full_name":"Borghi M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Umbria e delle Marche, 06126 Perugia, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-6337-5999"}},{"given_name":"Alessandro","family_name":"Graziani","full_name":"Graziani A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology Section, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-7833-3425"}},{"given_name":"Daniele","family_name":"Marini","full_name":"Marini D","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Microbiology Unit, Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital, 06132 Perugia, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Elisabetta","family_name":"Madonna","full_name":"Madonna E","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Infectious Diseases, Unit of Viral Hepatitis and Oncovirus and Retrovirus Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Umbertina","family_name":"Villano","full_name":"Villano U","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Infectious Diseases, Unit of Viral Hepatitis and Oncovirus and Retrovirus Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-5236-041X"}},{"given_name":"Elisabetta","family_name":"Suffredini","full_name":"Suffredini E","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-7605-0539"}},{"given_name":"Teresa","family_name":"Vicenza","full_name":"Vicenza T","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9524-8476"}},{"given_name":"Elida","family_name":"Mataj","full_name":"Mataj E","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Institute of Public Health (ISHP), 1000 Tirana, Albania."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Roberto","family_name":"Bruni","full_name":"Bruni R","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Infectious Diseases, Unit of Viral Hepatitis and Oncovirus and Retrovirus Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-3035-5510"}},{"given_name":"Anna Rita","family_name":"Ciccaglione","full_name":"Ciccaglione AR","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Infectious Diseases, Unit of Viral Hepatitis and Oncovirus and Retrovirus Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Barbara","family_name":"Camilloni","full_name":"Camilloni B","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology Section, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.","Microbiology Unit, Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital, 06132 Perugia, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-2198-0127"}},{"given_name":"Silvia","family_name":"Bozza","full_name":"Bozza S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology Section, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.","Microbiology Unit, Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital, 06132 Perugia, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}}],"full_text_url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v16121869","citation_count":0,"keywords":["Hepatitis E virus","Viral hepatitis","phylogenetic analyses","foodborne disease","Genotype 3"],"subjects":["Animals","Swine","Sus scrofa","Humans","Hepatitis E virus","Hepatitis E","Fatal Outcome","Phylogeny","Genotype","Aged","Italy","Male"],"funding_info":[],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"Antimicrobial activity, membrane interaction and structural features of short arginine-rich antimicrobial peptides.","abstract":"Antimicrobial activity of many AMPs can be improved by lysine-to-arginine substitution due to a more favourable interaction of arginine guanidinium moiety with bacterial membranes. In a previous work, the structural and functional characterization of an amphipathic antimicrobial peptide named RiLK1, including lysine and arginine as the positively charged amino acids in its sequence, was reported. Specifically, RiLK1 retained its β-sheet structure under a wide range of environmental conditions (temperature, pH, and ionic strength), and exhibited bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungal pathogens with no evidence of toxicity on mammalian cells. To further elucidate the influence of a lysine-to-arginine replacement on RiLK1 conformational properties, antimicrobial activity and peptide-liposome interaction, a new RiLK1-derivative, named RiLK3, in which the lysine is replaced with an arginine residue, was projected and characterised in comparison with its parental compound. The results evidenced that lysine-to-arginine mutation not only did not assure an improvement in the antimicrobial potency of RiLK1 in terms of bactericidal, virucidal and fungicidal activities, but rather it was completely abolished against the hepatitis A virus. Therefore, RiLK1 exhibited a wide range of antimicrobial activity like other cationic peptides, although the exact mechanisms of action are not completely understood. Moreover, tryptophan fluorescence measurements confirmed that RiLK3 bound to negatively charged lipid vesicles with an affinity lower than that of RiLK1, although no substantial differences from the structural and self-assembled point of view were evidenced. Therefore, our findings imply that antimicrobial efficacy and selectivity are affected by several complex and interrelated factors related to substitution of lysine with arginine, such as their relative proportion and position. In this context, this study could provide a better rationalisation for the optimization of antimicrobial peptide sequences, paving the way for the development of novel AMPs with broad applications.","doi":"10.3389/fmicb.2023.1244325","publication_date":"2023-10-05T00:00:00","journal_name":"Frontiers in microbiology","journal_issn":"1664-302X","authors":[{"given_name":"Bruna","family_name":"Agrillo","full_name":"Agrillo B","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Ampure S.R.L., Napoli, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Alessandra","family_name":"Porritiello","full_name":"Porritiello A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Research Council (IBBR-CNR), Institute of Biosciences and Bioresources, Napoli, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Lorena","family_name":"Gratino","full_name":"Gratino L","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Research Council (IBBR-CNR), Institute of Biosciences and Bioresources, Napoli, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Marco","family_name":"Balestrieri","full_name":"Balestrieri M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Research Council (IBBR-CNR), Institute of Biosciences and Bioresources, Napoli, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-4343-2148"}},{"given_name":"Yolande Therese","family_name":"Proroga","full_name":"Proroga YT","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Microbiology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno, Portici, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Andrea","family_name":"Mancusi","full_name":"Mancusi A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Microbiology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno, Portici, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-7069-3274"}},{"given_name":"Loredana","family_name":"Cozzi","full_name":"Cozzi L","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-8593-7550"}},{"given_name":"Teresa","family_name":"Vicenza","full_name":"Vicenza T","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9524-8476"}},{"given_name":"Principia","family_name":"Dardano","full_name":"Dardano P","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Research Council (ISASI-CNR), Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems, Napoli, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Bruno","family_name":"Miranda","full_name":"Miranda B","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Research Council (ISASI-CNR), Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems, Napoli, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-8746-833X"}},{"given_name":"Pablo V","family_name":"Escribá","full_name":"Escribá PV","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biomedicine, University of the Balearic Islands, Palma, Spain.","Laminar Pharmaceuticals, Palma, Spain."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Marta","family_name":"Gogliettino","full_name":"Gogliettino M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Research Council (IBBR-CNR), Institute of Biosciences and Bioresources, Napoli, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Gianna","family_name":"Palmieri","full_name":"Palmieri G","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Research Council (IBBR-CNR), Institute of Biosciences and Bioresources, Napoli, Italy.","Materias S.R.L., Naples, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}}],"full_text_url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1244325/pdf?isPublishedV2=False","citation_count":3,"keywords":["Arginine","Membrane interaction","Spectroscopy","Antimicrobial Compound","Cationic Arginine-rich Peptide"],"subjects":[],"funding_info":[],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"A Reliable Multifaceted Solution against Foodborne Viral Infections: The Case of RiLK1 Decapeptide.","abstract":"Food-borne transmission is a recognized route for many viruses associated with gastrointestinal, hepatic, or neurological diseases. Therefore, it is essential to identify new bioactive compounds with broad-spectrum antiviral activity to exploit innovative solutions against these hazards. Recently, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been recognized as promising antiviral agents. Indeed, while the antibacterial and antifungal effects of these molecules have been widely reported, their use as potential antiviral agents has not yet been fully investigated. Herein, the antiviral activity of previously identified or newly designed AMPs was evaluated against the non-enveloped RNA viruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and murine norovirus (MNV), a surrogate for human norovirus. Moreover, specific assays were performed to recognize at which stage of the viral infection cycle the peptides could function. The results showed that almost all peptides displayed virucidal effects, with about 90% of infectivity reduction in HAV or MNV. However, the decapeptide RiLK1 demonstrated, together with its antibacterial and antifungal properties, a notable reduction in viral infection for both HAV and MNV, possibly through direct interaction with viral particles causing their damage or hindering the recognition of cellular receptors. Hence, RiLK1 could represent a versatile antimicrobial agent effective against various foodborne pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and fungi.","doi":"10.3390/molecules29102305","publication_date":"2024-05-14T00:00:00","journal_name":"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","journal_issn":"1420-3049","authors":[{"given_name":"Emanuela","family_name":"Galatola","full_name":"Galatola E","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Institute of Biosciences and BioResources (IBBR), National Research Council (CNR), 80131 Naples, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Bruna","family_name":"Agrillo","full_name":"Agrillo B","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Institute of Biosciences and BioResources (IBBR), National Research Council (CNR), 80131 Naples, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Marta","family_name":"Gogliettino","full_name":"Gogliettino M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Institute of Biosciences and BioResources (IBBR), National Research Council (CNR), 80131 Naples, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Gianna","family_name":"Palmieri","full_name":"Palmieri G","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Institute of Biosciences and BioResources (IBBR), National Research Council (CNR), 80131 Naples, Italy.","Materias Srl, 80146 Naples, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9007-4075"}},{"given_name":"Serena","family_name":"Maccaroni","full_name":"Maccaroni S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Reference Laboratory for Foodborne Viruses, Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Teresa","family_name":"Vicenza","full_name":"Vicenza T","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Reference Laboratory for Foodborne Viruses, Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9524-8476"}},{"given_name":"Yolande T R","family_name":"Proroga","full_name":"Proroga YTR","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Microbiology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno, 80055 Portici, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-2748-9286"}},{"given_name":"Andrea","family_name":"Mancusi","full_name":"Mancusi A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Microbiology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno, 80055 Portici, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-7069-3274"}},{"given_name":"Simona","family_name":"Di Pasquale","full_name":"Di Pasquale S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Reference Laboratory for Foodborne Viruses, Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-7339-3736"}},{"given_name":"Elisabetta","family_name":"Suffredini","full_name":"Suffredini E","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Reference Laboratory for Foodborne Viruses, Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-7605-0539"}},{"given_name":"Loredana","family_name":"Cozzi","full_name":"Cozzi L","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Reference Laboratory for Foodborne Viruses, Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-8593-7550"}}],"full_text_url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/10/2305/pdf?version=1715682310","citation_count":1,"keywords":["Hepatitis A virus","Antimicrobial peptide","Enteroviruses","Non-enveloped Virus","Murine Norovirus","Virucidal Activity","Foodborne Viral Infections"],"subjects":["Animals","Humans","Mice","Hepatitis A virus","Norovirus","Virus Diseases","Antiviral Agents","Microbial Sensitivity Tests","Foodborne Diseases","Antimicrobial Peptides"],"funding_info":[{"name":null,"funder":"Ministero della Salute","grant_number":"IZS ME 06/20 RC"}],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"Presence of Zonula Occludens Toxin-Coding Genes among <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> Isolates of Clinical and Environmental Origin.","abstract":"In recent studies, emphasis has been placed on the zonula occludens toxin (Zot) from the non-toxigenic <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> strain PMC53.7 as an agent inducing alterations in the actin cytoskeleton of infected Caco-2 cells and which appears as a relevant virulence factor.

(dd RT-PCR) Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Honey Bees and Honey Collected in Apiaries across the Campania Region.","abstract":"Coronaviruses (CoVs), a subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae, are viruses that sometimes present a zoonotic character. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, which, since its outbreak in 2019, has caused about 774,593,066 confirmed cases and 7,028,881 deaths. Aereosols are the main route of transmission among people; however, viral droplets can contaminate surfaces and fomites as well as particulate matter (PM) in suspensions of natural and human origin. Honey bees are well known bioindicators of the presence of pollutants and PMs in the environment as they can collect a great variety of substances during their foraging activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of honey bees as bioindicators of the prevalence SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, 91 samples of honey bees and 6 of honey were collected from different apiaries of Campania region (Southern Italy) in four time periods from September 2020 to June 2022 and were analyzed with Droplet Digital RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 target genes Orf1b and N. The screening revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 12/91 in honey bee samples and in 2/6 honey samples. These results suggest that honey bees could also be used as indicators of outbreaks of airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.","doi":"10.3390/v16050729","publication_date":"2024-05-04T00:00:00","journal_name":"Viruses","journal_issn":"1999-4915","authors":[{"given_name":"Andrea","family_name":"Mancusi","full_name":"Mancusi A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Security Coordination, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno, Via Salute No. 2, 80055 Portici, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-7069-3274"}},{"given_name":"Yolande Thérèse Rose","family_name":"Proroga","full_name":"Proroga YTR","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Security Coordination, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno, Via Salute No. 2, 80055 Portici, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-2748-9286"}},{"given_name":"Paola","family_name":"Maiolino","full_name":"Maiolino P","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Naples Federico II, 80137 Naples, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-8863-466X"}},{"given_name":"Raffaele","family_name":"Marrone","full_name":"Marrone R","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Naples Federico II, 80137 Naples, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-2888-5846"}},{"given_name":"Claudia","family_name":"D'Emilio","full_name":"D'Emilio C","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Naples Federico II, 80137 Naples, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0009-0007-8543-9934"}},{"given_name":"Santa","family_name":"Girardi","full_name":"Girardi S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Security Coordination, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno, Via Salute No. 2, 80055 Portici, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Marica","family_name":"Egidio","full_name":"Egidio M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Naples Federico II, 80137 Naples, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Arianna","family_name":"Boni","full_name":"Boni A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-4561-3578"}},{"given_name":"Teresa","family_name":"Vicenza","full_name":"Vicenza T","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9524-8476"}},{"given_name":"Elisabetta","family_name":"Suffredini","full_name":"Suffredini E","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-7605-0539"}},{"given_name":"Karen","family_name":"Power","full_name":"Power K","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Biology, University of Naples Federico II, 80126 Naples, Italy."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-2940-7520"}}],"full_text_url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v16050729","citation_count":0,"keywords":["bioindicators","Honey bees","Droplet Digital Rt-pcr","Sars-cov-2"],"subjects":["Animals","Humans","Bees","RNA, Viral","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Honey","Italy","COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2"],"funding_info":[],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"The human cytomegalovirus nuclear egress complex unites multiple functions: Recruitment of effectors, nuclear envelope rearrangement, and docking to nuclear capsids.","abstract":"<h4>Background</h4>Nuclear replication represents a common hallmark of herpesviruses achieved by a number of sequentially unrolled regulatory processes. A rate-limiting step is provided by nucleo-cytoplasmic capsid export, for which a defined multiregulatory protein complex, namely, the nuclear egress complex (NEC), is assembled comprising both viral and cellular components. The NEC regulates at least 3 aspects of herpesviral nuclear replication: (1) multimeric recruitment of NEC-associated effector proteins, (2) reorganization of the nuclear lamina and membranes, and (3) the docking to nuclear capsids. Here, we review published data and own experimental work that characterizes the NEC of HCMV and other herpesviruses.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review of information on nuclear egress of HCMV compared to selected alpha-, beta-, and gamma-herpesviruses: proteomics-based approaches, high-resolution imaging techniques, and functional investigations.<h4>Results</h4>A large number of reports on herpesviral NECs have been published during the last two decades, focusing on protein-protein interactions, nuclear localization, regulatory phosphorylation, and functional validation. The emerging picture provides an illustrated example of well-balanced and sophisticated protein networking in virus-host interaction.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Current evidence refined the view about herpesviral NECs. Datasets published for HCMV, murine CMV, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus illustrate the marked functional consistency in the way herpesviruses achieve nuclear egress. However, this compares with only limited sequence conservation of core NEC proteins and a structural conservation restricted to individual domains. The translational use of this information might help to define a novel antiviral strategy on the basis of NEC-directed small molecules.","doi":"10.1002/rmv.1934","publication_date":"2017-06-30T00:00:00","journal_name":"Reviews in medical virology","journal_issn":"1052-9276","authors":[{"given_name":"Manfred","family_name":"Marschall","full_name":"Marschall M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-3375-850X"}},{"given_name":"Yves A","family_name":"Muller","full_name":"Muller YA","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Division of Biotechnology, Department of Biology, FAU, Erlangen, Germany."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Benedikt","family_name":"Diewald","full_name":"Diewald B","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Division of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biochemistry, FAU, Erlangen, Germany."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Heinrich","family_name":"Sticht","full_name":"Sticht H","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Division of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biochemistry, FAU, Erlangen, Germany."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-5644-045X"}},{"given_name":"Jens","family_name":"Milbradt","full_name":"Milbradt J","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-2172-7471"}}],"full_text_url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.1934","citation_count":36,"keywords":["Human cytomegalovirus","Antiviral drugs","Herpesviruses","Nuclear Egress Complex","Capsid-nec Docking"],"subjects":["Nuclear Envelope","Animals","Humans","Mice","Simplexvirus","Cytomegalovirus","Muromegalovirus","Herpesvirus 4, Human","Capsid","Biological Transport","Virus Release"],"funding_info":[],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]}]
