    "abstract": "This review explores the application of the Simplex representation of molecular structure (SiRMS) QSAR approach in antiviral research. We provide an introduction to and description of SiRMS, its application in antiviral research and future directions of development of the Simplex approach and the whole QSAR field. In the Simplex approach every molecule is represented as a system of different simplexes (tetratomic fragments with fixed composition, structure, chirality and symmetry). The main advantages of SiRMS are consideration of the different physical-chemical properties of atoms, high adequacy and good interpretability of models obtained and clear procedures for molecular design. The reliability of developed QSAR models as predictive virtual screening tools and their ability to serve as the basis of directed drug design was validated by subsequent synthetic and biological experiments. The SiRMS approach is realized as the complex of the computer program 'HiT QSAR', which is available on request.",

    "abstract": "Foot and Mouth Disease Virus causes continuously annoying outbreaks and massive animal illnesses. Usually, the potential influence of the disease was due to the emergence of conquered emergent new strains or re-emergence of local strains with major antigenic variations due to the mutation in the genetic strip. Therefore, the proposed work is based on the genetic characterization of the virus by VP1 codon sequencing in the tested samples. Besides, the viral physiological testing using BHK-21 cell lines and the ELISA test for FMDV antigen serotyping. Positive serotype A samples were furtherly analyzed for nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequences showed that they belonged to the FMD serotype A African topotypes originating from the ancestor prototype SUD/77 with a similarity of 98.48\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2% with each other. The divergence was 9.3% from the other local isolates from 2020. Additionally, they are closely related to the Egyptian-Damietta type-2016 and the Sudanese-2018 by 96.84\u2009\u00b1\u20091.01% and 95.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.79%, respectively. Moreover, the divergence with the vaccinal strains ranged from 10 to 17%. Ultimately, the analysis of the amino acid showed that the isolates have variation in the most prominent antigenic regionsof of, allocated at residues 35\u201375, and at the immunogenic determinants of the G-H loop of VP1 (residues 100\u2013146, residues 161\u2013175). Therefore, the current isolates should be included in the vaccine to provide broader immunogenic coverages against serotype A-African topotypes.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background and aim</h4>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus causes continuous outbreaks, leading to serious economic consequences that affect animal productivity and restrict trade movement. The potential influence of the disease was due to the emergence of new strains or re-emergence of local strains with major antigenic variations due to genetic mutations. This study aims to evaluate circulating virus in samples collected from infected animals during an outbreak using antigenic characterization and identify whether there is an emergence of a new strain or mutation.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to screen 86 samples. Viral protein 1 (VP1) codon sequencing was performed. The virus was isolated from the samples inoculated on the baby-hamster kidney cell line and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed for serotyping and antigen detection.<h4>Results</h4>Based on the RT-PCR screening results, 10 positive samples were selected for sequencing. The sequences belonged to the FMD serotype A African topotype originating from the ancestor prototype Sudan/77, with which it shared 98.48% \u00b1 1.2% similarity. The divergence with local isolates from 2020 was 9.3%. In addition, the sequences were 96.84% \u00b1 1.01% and 95.84% \u00b1 0.79% related to Egyptian-Damietta type 2016 and Sudanese-2018, respectively. Divergence with vaccinal strains ranged from 10% to 17%. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the isolates had variation in the most prominent antigenic regions (residues 35-75) and the immunogenic determinants of the G-H loop of VP1 (residues 100-146 and 161-175).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current isolates should be included in the locally produced vaccine to provide broader immunogenic coverage against serotype A African topotypes.",

We conducted this study to determine the prevalence of persistent infections (PI) and identify the current strain among some dairy cattle herds in Egypt. A total of 240 serum samples were collected from six Egyptian provinces. Between 2019 and 2020, samples were tested by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of PI animals, and then molecular characterization was performed. Six calves were found PI with a prevalence of 2.5% (6/240). Using molecular characterization, HoBi-like Pestivirus (BVD-3) was successfully identified in Egypt for the first time. Based on the BVD-3 reference strains on Genbank, the detected strains had an identity ranging from 98.8 to 99.6%. Partial nucleotide sequence of the 5'UTR gene for six tested samples was submitted to Genbank with accessions: OM324396, OM324397, OM324398, OM324399, OM3243100, and OM3243101.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background and aim</h4>Bovine papillomaviruses (BPV) are a heterogeneous group of oncoviruses, distributed globally, which produce major economic losses. In the current study, we compared the results of different diagnostic approaches and compared the strains identified in this study with previously characterized strains at local and international levels.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Samples of skin warts were collected from five bovines with generalized papillomatosis from two Egyptian provinces, Menya and Ismailia, in 2020. Electron microscopy, molecular characterization, histopathological, and immunohistochemical examination were performed.<h4>Results</h4>BPV was detected using electron microscopy in the collected samples. Using molecular characterization, BPV-2 was successfully identified for 1<sup>st</sup> time in Egypt. The strain has 99.6% identity with the BPV-2 reference strains obtained from GenBank. These results were supported by histopathology and immunohistochemistry examination. Partial nucleotide sequences of the L1 gene were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers MW289843 and MW289844.<h4>Conclusion</h4>BPV-2 was reported for 1<sup>st</sup> time in the current study. The strain was identified grossly, microscopically, and pathologically and confirmed using molecular approaches. All results were consistent. The sequence analysis revealed that this strain has high sequence similarity to the reference Deltapapillomavirus-4, BPV-2 strains from Brazil and China.",

    "abstract": "The first nationally representative, population-based study of schistosomiasis seroprevalence in Nigeria was conducted using blood samples and risk-factor data collected during the 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS). Schistosomiasis seroprevalence was estimated by analyzing samples for reactivity to schistosome soluble egg antigen (SEA) in a multiplex bead assay; NAIIS survey data were assessed to identify potential risk factors for seropositivity. The SEA antibody data were available for 31,459 children aged 0 to 14 years. Overall seroprevalence was 17.2% (95% CI: 16.3-18.1%). Seropositive children were identified in every age group, including children < 5 years, and seroprevalence increased with increasing age (P < 0.0001). Several factors were associated with increased odds of seropositivity, including being a boy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.24-1.45), living in a rural area (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.9-2.5), and animal ownership (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.52-1.85). Access to improved sanitation and drinking water sources were associated with decreased odds of seropositivity (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.47-0.58 and OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.47-0.60, respectively) regardless of whether the child lived in a rural (sanitation: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.8; drinking water: aOR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.8) or urban area (sanitation: aOR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.5-0.7; drinking water: aOR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4-0.6), highlighting the importance of these factors for schistosomiasis prevention and control. These results identified additional risk populations (children < 5 years) and a new risk factor (animal ownership) and could be used to monitor the impact of control programs.",

Simultaneous, serological testing for multiple pathogens can be done using bead-based immunoassays to add value to disease-specific serosurveys. We conducted a validation of four SARS-CoV-2 antigens-full-length spike protein, two receptor binding domain proteins, and the nucleocapsid protein-on our existing multiplex bead assay (MBA) for enteric diseases, malaria, and vaccine preventable diseases. After determining the optimal conditions for coupling the antigens to microsphere beads, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined on two instruments (Luminex-200 and MAGPIX) when testing singly (monoplex) versus combined (multiplex). Sensitivity was assessed using plasma from 87 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) positive persons collected in March-May of 2020 and ranged from 94.3% to 96.6% for the different testing conditions. Specificity was assessed using 98 plasma specimens collected prior to December 2019 and plasma from 19 rRT-PCR negative persons and ranged from 97.4% to 100%. The positive percent agreement was 93.8% to 97.9% using 48 specimens collected > 21 days post-symptom onset, while the negative percent agreement was \u2265 99% for all antigens. Test performance was similar using monoplex or multiplex testing. Integrating SARS-CoV-2 serology with other diseases of public health interest could add significant value to public health programs that have suffered severe programmatic setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Multiplex assays for malaria antigen detection can gather data from large sample sets, but considerations for the consistency and quality assurance (QA) of mass testing lack evaluation. We present a QA framework for a study occurring November 2019 to March 2020 involving 504 assay plates detecting four Plasmodium antigens: pan-Plasmodium aldolase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), P. vivax LDH (PvLDH). Controls on each plate included buffer blank, antigen negative blood, and 4-point positive dilution curve. The blank and negative blood provided consistently low signal for all targets except for pAldolase, which showed variability. Positive curve signals decreased throughout the 5-month study duration but retained a coefficient of variation (CV) of\u2009<\u20095%, with the exception of HRP2 in month 5 (CV of 11%). Regression fittings for inter-plate control signals provided mean and standard deviations (SDs), and of 504 assay plates, 6 (1.2%) violated the acceptable deviation limits and were repeated. For the 40,272 human blood samples assayed in this study, of 161,088 potential data points (each sample\u2009\u00d7\u20094 antigens), 160,641 (99.7%) successfully passed quality checks. The QA framework presented here can be utilized to ensure quality of laboratory antigen detection for large sample sets.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Objective</h4>There is a need for reliable serological assays to determine accurate estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence. Most single target antigen assays have shown some limitations in Africa. To assess the performance of a multi-antigen assay, we evaluated a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay for human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nigeria.<h4>Methods</h4>Validation of the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay was carried out using well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reactive positive (97) and pre-COVID-19 pandemic (86) plasma panels. Cross-reactivity was assessed using pre-COVID-19 pandemic plasma specimens (213) from the 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS).<h4>Results</h4>The overall sensitivity of the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay was 75.3% [95% CI: 65.8%- 82.8%] and specificity was 99.0% [95% CI: 96.8%- 99.7%]. The sensitivity estimate increased to 83.3% [95% CI: 70.4%- 91.3%] for specimens >14 days post-confirmation of diagnosis. However, using the NAIIS pre-pandemic specimens, the false positivity rate was 1.4% (3/213).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results showed overall lower sensitivity and a comparable specificity with the manufacturer's validation. There appears to be less cross-reactivity with NAIIS pre-pandemic COVID-19 specimens using the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay. In-country SARS-CoV-2 serology assay validation can help guide the best choice of assays in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a global health problem, causing an estimated 20 million infections annually. Thus, the management of HEV requires special consideration. In developed countries, hepatitis E is mainly recognized as a foodborne disease (mainly transmitted via undercooked meat consumption) that is generally caused by genotype 3 and 4 circulating in various animals, including pigs and wild boars. The current absence of officially recognized protocols for the analysis of HEV in foods and the lack of awareness of this disease among healthcare workers, together with the high percentage of asymptomatic cases, make HEV infection highly underestimated. Most HEV-3 infections in immunocompetent individuals are self-limited. Nevertheless, the possibility of serious forms of liver disease, especially in patients with co-morbidities, should be considered because it can lead to a fatal outcome. Here, we report a case of fatal hepatitis related to HEV-3 infection in a 67-year-old male patient with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD) and living in a region where a high prevalence and genetic heterogeneity of HEV-3 in wild boar has been recently demonstrated. Our case report describes the interdisciplinary approach used (from the diagnosis to the virus phylogenetic characterization) in order to improve epidemiologic HEV surveillance in central Italy.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial activity of many AMPs can be improved by lysine-to-arginine substitution due to a more favourable interaction of arginine guanidinium moiety with bacterial membranes. In a previous work, the structural and functional characterization of an amphipathic antimicrobial peptide named RiLK1, including lysine and arginine as the positively charged amino acids in its sequence, was reported. Specifically, RiLK1 retained its \u03b2-sheet structure under a wide range of environmental conditions (temperature, pH, and ionic strength), and exhibited bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungal pathogens with no evidence of toxicity on mammalian cells. To further elucidate the influence of a lysine-to-arginine replacement on RiLK1 conformational properties, antimicrobial activity and peptide-liposome interaction, a new RiLK1-derivative, named RiLK3, in which the lysine is replaced with an arginine residue, was projected and characterised in comparison with its parental compound. The results evidenced that lysine-to-arginine mutation not only did not assure an improvement in the antimicrobial potency of RiLK1 in terms of bactericidal, virucidal and fungicidal activities, but rather it was completely abolished against the hepatitis A virus. Therefore, RiLK1 exhibited a wide range of antimicrobial activity like other cationic peptides, although the exact mechanisms of action are not completely understood. Moreover, tryptophan fluorescence measurements confirmed that RiLK3 bound to negatively charged lipid vesicles with an affinity lower than that of RiLK1, although no substantial differences from the structural and self-assembled point of view were evidenced. Therefore, our findings imply that antimicrobial efficacy and selectivity are affected by several complex and interrelated factors related to substitution of lysine with arginine, such as their relative proportion and position. In this context, this study could provide a better rationalisation for the optimization of antimicrobial peptide sequences, paving the way for the development of novel AMPs with broad applications.",

    "abstract": "Food-borne transmission is a recognized route for many viruses associated with gastrointestinal, hepatic, or neurological diseases. Therefore, it is essential to identify new bioactive compounds with broad-spectrum antiviral activity to exploit innovative solutions against these hazards. Recently, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been recognized as promising antiviral agents. Indeed, while the antibacterial and antifungal effects of these molecules have been widely reported, their use as potential antiviral agents has not yet been fully investigated. Herein, the antiviral activity of previously identified or newly designed AMPs was evaluated against the non-enveloped RNA viruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and murine norovirus (MNV), a surrogate for human norovirus. Moreover, specific assays were performed to recognize at which stage of the viral infection cycle the peptides could function. The results showed that almost all peptides displayed virucidal effects, with about 90% of infectivity reduction in HAV or MNV. However, the decapeptide RiLK1 demonstrated, together with its antibacterial and antifungal properties, a notable reduction in viral infection for both HAV and MNV, possibly through direct interaction with viral particles causing their damage or hindering the recognition of cellular receptors. Hence, RiLK1 could represent a versatile antimicrobial agent effective against various foodborne pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and fungi.",

Universal <i>zot</i> primers were designed by the alignment of different types of <i>zot</i> gene and identification of conserved sequences to investigate the presence in diverse environmental and clinical <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> isolates, in co-occurrence with virulence factors, such a hemolysins and secretion systems. The study screened a total of 390 isolates from environmental sources from Chile and Italy and 95 Chilean clinical isolates. The results revealed that around 37.2% of Chilean environmental strains and 25.9% of Italian strains, and 24.2% of clinical isolates carried the <i>zot</i> gene. The Zot-C2 cluster was present in 71.4% of Chilean environmental strains but absent in clinical isolates, while the Zot-C4 cluster was identified in 28.6% of environmental and 100% of clinical isolates. Understanding the role of <i>zot</i> in <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> virulence is crucial, especially considering the risk associated with consuming diverse isolates from bivalves and the co-occurrence with virulence factors such as TDH, TRH or T3SS2.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses (CoVs), a subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae, are viruses that sometimes present a zoonotic character. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, which, since its outbreak in 2019, has caused about 774,593,066 confirmed cases and 7,028,881 deaths. Aereosols are the main route of transmission among people; however, viral droplets can contaminate surfaces and fomites as well as particulate matter (PM) in suspensions of natural and human origin. Honey bees are well known bioindicators of the presence of pollutants and PMs in the environment as they can collect a great variety of substances during their foraging activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of honey bees as bioindicators of the prevalence SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, 91 samples of honey bees and 6 of honey were collected from different apiaries of Campania region (Southern Italy) in four time periods from September 2020 to June 2022 and were analyzed with Droplet Digital RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 target genes Orf1b and N. The screening revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 12/91 in honey bee samples and in 2/6 honey samples. These results suggest that honey bees could also be used as indicators of outbreaks of airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Nuclear replication represents a common hallmark of herpesviruses achieved by a number of sequentially unrolled regulatory processes. A rate-limiting step is provided by nucleo-cytoplasmic capsid export, for which a defined multiregulatory protein complex, namely, the nuclear egress complex (NEC), is assembled comprising both viral and cellular components. The NEC regulates at least 3 aspects of herpesviral nuclear replication: (1) multimeric recruitment of NEC-associated effector proteins, (2) reorganization of the nuclear lamina and membranes, and (3) the docking to nuclear capsids. Here, we review published data and own experimental work that characterizes the NEC of HCMV and other herpesviruses.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review of information on nuclear egress of HCMV compared to selected alpha-, beta-, and gamma-herpesviruses: proteomics-based approaches, high-resolution imaging techniques, and functional investigations.<h4>Results</h4>A large number of reports on herpesviral NECs have been published during the last two decades, focusing on protein-protein interactions, nuclear localization, regulatory phosphorylation, and functional validation. The emerging picture provides an illustrated example of well-balanced and sophisticated protein networking in virus-host interaction.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Current evidence refined the view about herpesviral NECs. Datasets published for HCMV, murine CMV, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus illustrate the marked functional consistency in the way herpesviruses achieve nuclear egress. However, this compares with only limited sequence conservation of core NEC proteins and a structural conservation restricted to individual domains. The translational use of this information might help to define a novel antiviral strategy on the basis of NEC-directed small molecules.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Allergic diseases have escalated to epidemic levels worldwide, impacting nearly 30% of the global population. Fungi are a significant source of allergens responsible for up to 6% of respiratory diseases in the general population. However, the specific cause of respiratory allergies often remains unidentified. This study aimed to investigate the potential of two common rust fungi, <i>Tranzschelia pruni-spinosae</i> and <i>Phragmidium rubi-idaei</i>, to trigger a proinflammatory response in vitro models representing the upper and lower respiratory tract.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The BEAS-2B and A549 cell lines simulated upper and lower respiratory endothelial cells. The cytotoxicity of fungal extracts was evaluated using MTT and flow cytometry assays. Cell reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured via flow cytometry, while ELISA tests quantified the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Immunofluorescence techniques were employed to assess cell integrity markers.<h4>Results</h4>Extracts from <i>T. pruni-spinosae</i> and <i>P. rubi-idaei</i> significantly stimulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and GM-CSF in both cell lines, all of which are associated with the development of allergic responses. The increase in these cytokines and the elevated ROS production were linked to the disruption of epithelial cell junctions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings suggest the potential of <i>T. pruni-spinosae</i> and <i>P. rubi-idaei</i> extracts to collectively disrupt the epithelial barrier in the upper and lower respiratory tract by inducing proinflammatory cytokines and the production of reactive oxygen species and metalloproteinases. Although none of the above parameters was spectacularly high, all of them together could cause a decrease in the presence of tight junction proteins, such as E-cadherin and occludin, in epithelial cells.",

This article intends to review published reports addressing the role of fungi as causative agents in the development of various overreactivity-related diseases, mainly affecting the respiratory tract. After presenting the basic information on the mechanisms of allergic reactions, we describe the impact of fungal allergens on the development of the allergic diseases. Human activity and climate change have an impact on the spread of fungi and their plant hosts. Particular attention should be paid to microfungi, i.e., plant parasites that may be an underestimated source of new allergens.",

    "abstract": "By June 2022, COVID-19 vaccine coverage in low-income countries remained low, while the emergence of the highly-transmissible but less clinically-severe Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the assumption expressed outside the academic realm that Omicron may offer a natural solution to the pandemic. The present paper argues that this assumption is based on the false premise that this variant could be the final evolutionary step of SARS-CoV-2. There remains a risk of the emergence of novel viral subvariants and recombinants, and entirely novel lineages, the clinical consequences of which are hard to predict. This is particularly important for regions with a high share of immunocompromised individuals, such as those living with HIV/AIDS, in whom SARS-CoV-2 can persist for months and undergo selection pressure. The vaccination of the least-vaccinated regions should remain the integral strategy to control viral evolution and its potential global consequences in developed countries, some of which have decided to ease sanitary and testing measures in response to the rise and dominance of the Omicron variant. We argue that low-income countries require help in improving COVID-19 vaccine availability, decreasing vaccine hesitancy, and increasing the understanding of long-term vaccination goals during the circulation of a viral variant that causes milder disease.",

    "abstract": "<i>Legionella pneumophila</i> is the primary causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. The mutant-type strain interrupted in the ORF7 gene region responsible for the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis of the <i>L. pneumophila</i> strain Heysham-1, lacking the <i>O</i>-acetyl groups attached to the rhamnose of the core part, showed a higher surface polarity compared with the wild-type strain. The measurement of excitation energy transfer between fluorophores located on the surface of bacteria and eukaryotic cells showed that, at an early stage of interaction with host cells, the mutant exhibited weaker interactions with <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i> cells and THP-1-derived macrophages. The mutant displayed reduced adherence to macrophages but enhanced adherence to <i>A. castellanii</i>, suggesting that the <i>O</i>-acetyl group of the LPS core region plays a crucial role in facilitating interaction with macrophages. The lack of core rhamnose <i>O</i>-acetyl groups made it easier for the bacteria to multiply in amoebae and macrophages. The mutant induced TNF-\u03b1 production more strongly compared with the wild-type strain. The mutant synthesized twice as many ceramides Cer(t34:0) and Cer(t38:0) than the wild-type strain. The study showed that the internal sugars of the LPS core region of <i>L. pneumophila</i> sg 1 can interact with eukaryotic cell surface receptors and mediate in contacting and attaching bacteria to host cells as well as modulating the immune response to infection.",

    "abstract": "During persistent human papillomavirus infection, the viral genome replicates as an extrachromosomal plasmid that is efficiently partitioned to daughter cells during cell division. We have previously shown that an element which overlaps the human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18) transcriptional enhancer promotes stable DNA replication of replicons containing the viral replication origin. Here, we perform comprehensive analyses to elucidate the function of this maintenance element. We conclude that no unique element or binding site in this region is absolutely required for persistent replication and partitioning and instead propose that the overall chromatin architecture of this region is important to promote efficient use of the replication origin. These results have important implications for the genome partitioning mechanism of papillomaviruses. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Persistent infection with oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is responsible for \u223c5% of human cancers. The viral DNA replicates as an extrachromosomal plasmid and is partitioned to daughter cells in dividing keratinocytes. Using a complementation assay that allows us to separate viral transcription and replication, we provide insight into viral sequences that are required for long-term replication and persistence in keratinocytes. Understanding how viral genomes replicate persistently for such long periods of time will guide the development of antiviral therapies.",

    "abstract": "Persistent infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types is responsible for ~5% of human cancers. The HPV infectious cycle can sustain long-term infection in stratified epithelia because viral DNA is maintained as low copy number extrachromosomal plasmids in the dividing basal cells of a lesion, while progeny viral genomes are amplified to large numbers in differentiated superficial cells. The viral E1 and E2 proteins initiate viral DNA replication and maintain and partition viral genomes, in concert with the cellular replication machinery. Additionally, the E5, E6, and E7 proteins are required to evade host immune responses and to produce a cellular environment that supports viral DNA replication. An unfortunate consequence of the manipulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation is that cells become at high risk for carcinogenesis.",

Viruses that use this tethering mechanism include papillomaviruses and the gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.

    "abstract": "<h4>Unlabelled</h4>In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) employs small RNAs to target enzymes that methylate cytosine residues. Cytosine methylation and dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) are often linked. Together they condition an epigenetic defense that results in chromatin compaction and transcriptional silencing of transposons and viral chromatin. Canonical RdDM (Pol IV-RdDM), involving RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol IV and Pol V), was believed to be necessary to establish cytosine methylation, which in turn could recruit H3K9 methyltransferases. However, recent studies have revealed that a pathway involving Pol II and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) (RDR6-RdDM) is likely responsible for establishing cytosine methylation at naive loci, while Pol IV-RdDM acts to reinforce and maintain it. We used the geminivirus Beet curly top virus (BCTV) as a model to examine the roles of Pol IV and Pol V in establishing repressive viral chromatin methylation. As geminivirus chromatin is formed de novo in infected cells, these viruses are unique models for processes involved in the establishment of epigenetic marks. We confirm that Pol IV and Pol V are not needed to establish viral DNA methylation but are essential for its amplification. Remarkably, however, both Pol IV and Pol V are required for deposition of H3K9me2 on viral chromatin. Our findings suggest that cytosine methylation alone is not sufficient to trigger de novo deposition of H3K9me2 and further that Pol IV-RdDM is responsible for recruiting H3K9 methyltransferases to viral chromatin.<h4>Importance</h4>In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) uses small RNAs to target cytosine methylation, which is often linked to H3K9me2. These epigenetic marks silence transposable elements and DNA virus genomes, but how they are established is not well understood. Canonical RdDM, involving Pol IV and Pol V, was thought to establish cytosine methylation that in turn could recruit H3K9 methyltransferases, but recent studies compel a reevaluation of this view. We used BCTV to investigate the roles of Pol IV and Pol V in chromatin methylation. We found that both are needed to amplify, but not to establish, DNA methylation. However, both are required for deposition of H3K9me2. Our findings suggest that cytosine methylation is not sufficient to recruit H3K9 methyltransferases to naive viral chromatin and further that Pol IV-RdDM is responsible.",

    "abstract": "Plants employ RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) to silence geminiviruses and transposable elements (TEs). We previously showed that canonical RdDM (Pol IV-RdDM) involving RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol IV and Pol V) is required for <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to recover from infection with <i>Beet curly top virus</i> lacking a suppressor protein that inhibits methylation (BCTV <i>L2</i><sup>-</sup>). Recovery, which is characterized by reduced viral DNA levels and symptom remission, allows normal floral development. Here, we used formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to confirm that >90% of BCTV <i>L2</i><sup>-</sup> chromatin is highly compacted during recovery, and a micrococcal nuclease-chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that this is largely due to increased nucleosome occupancy. Physical compaction correlated with augmented cytosine and H3K9 methylation and with reduced viral gene expression. We additionally demonstrated that these phenomena are dependent on Pol V and by extension the Pol IV-RdDM pathway. BCTV <i>L2</i><sup>-</sup> was also used to evaluate the impact of viral infection on host loci, including repressed retrotransposons <i>Ta3</i> and <i>Athila6A</i> Remarkably, an unexpected Pol V-dependent hypersuppression of these TEs was observed, resulting in transcript levels even lower than those detected in uninfected plants. Hypersuppression is likely to be especially important for natural recovery from wild-type geminiviruses, as viral L2 and AL2 proteins cause ectopic TE expression. Thus, Pol IV-RdDM targets both viral and TE chromatin during recovery, simultaneously silencing the majority of viral genomes and maintaining host genome integrity by enforcing tighter control of TEs in future reproductive tissues.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In plants, RdDM pathways use small RNAs to target cytosine and H3K9 methylation, thereby silencing DNA virus genomes and transposable elements (TEs). Further, Pol IV-RdDM involving Pol IV and Pol V is a key aspect of host defense that can lead to recovery from geminivirus infection. Recovery is characterized by reduced viral DNA levels and symptom remission and thus allows normal floral development. Studies described here demonstrate that the Pol V-dependent enhanced viral DNA and histone methylation observed during recovery result in increased chromatin compaction and suppressed gene expression. In addition, we show that TE-associated chromatin is also targeted for hypersuppression during recovery, such that TE transcripts are reduced below the already low levels seen in uninfected plants. Thus, Pol IV-RdDM at once silences the majority of viral genomes and enforces a tight control over TEs which might otherwise jeopardize genome integrity in future reproductive tissue.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most lethal and prevalent malignancies. While the overexpression of pioneer factor GATA6 in CRC has been linked with metastasis, its role in genome-wide gene expression dysregulation remains unclear. Through studies of primary human CRC tissues and analysis of the TCGA data, we found that GATA6 preferentially binds at CRC-specific active enhancers, with enrichment at enhancer-promoter loop anchors. GATA6 protein also physically interacts with CTCF, suggesting its critical role in 3D genome organization. The ablation of GATA6 through AID and CRISPR systems severely impaired cancer cell clonogenicity and proliferation. Mechanistically, GATA6 knockout induced global loss of CRC-specific open chromatins and extensive alterations of critical enhancer-promoter interactions for CRC oncogenes. Last, we showed that GATA6 knockout greatly reduced tumor growth and improved survival in mice. Together, we revealed a previously unidentified mechanism by which GATA6 contributes to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Among all of the known biological carcinogens, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are two of the classical oncogenic herpesviruses known to induce the oncogenic phenotype. Many studies have revealed important functions related to epigenetic alterations of the EBV and KSHV genomes that mediate oncogenesis, but the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. It is also challenging to fully describe the critical cellular events that drive oncogenesis as well as a comprehensive map of the molecular contributors. This review introduces the roles of epigenetic modifications of these viral genomes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and noncoding RNA expression, and elucidates potential strategies utilized for inducing oncogenesis by these human gammaherpesviruses.",

    "abstract": "Minority groups face barriers in accessing quality health care, professional advancement, and representation in immunology research efforts as a result of institutional racism that if unaddressed can perpetuate a lack of diversity. In 2021, the AAI Minority Affairs Committee convened a cross section of academic and industry scientists from underrepresented groups at various stages of their professions to discuss how best to address the toll racism takes on study design and scientific careers. Panelists drew directly from their own experiences as scientists to share perspectives and strategies for countering a lack of representation in clinical research, responding to microaggressions, navigating academic advancement, and providing effective mentorship. The session reinforced the need for minority scientists to take an active role in advocating for diversity, engaging mentors, and taking responsibility to face rather than avoid institutional obstacles. Overall, increased dialogue and institutional awareness of the experience of scientists from underrepresented groups in research remain the best tools to ensure a health equity mindset and advancement of their careers.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are exemplary molecular biologists and have been integral to scientific discovery for generations. It is therefore no surprise that nuclear replicating viruses have evolved to systematically take over host cell function through astoundingly specific nuclear and chromatin hijacking. In this review, we focus on nuclear replicating DNA viruses-herpesviruses and adenoviruses-as key examples of viral invasion in the nucleus. We concentrate on critical features of nuclear architecture, such as chromatin and the nucleolus, to illustrate the complexity of the virus-host battle for resources in the nucleus. We conclude with a discussion of the technological advances that have enabled the discoveries we describe and upcoming steps in this burgeoning field.",
