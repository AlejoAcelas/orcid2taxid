[{"title":"A screen for Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite surface protein binding to human hepatocyte surface receptors identifies novel host-pathogen interactions.","abstract":"<h4>Background</h4>Sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes is an essential step in the Plasmodium life-cycle and has similarities, at the cellular level, to merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. In the case of the Plasmodium blood-stage, efforts to identify host-pathogen protein-protein interactions have yielded important insights including vaccine candidates. In the case of sporozoite-hepatocyte invasion, the host-pathogen protein-protein interactions involved are poorly understood.<h4>Methods</h4>To gain a better understanding of the protein-protein interaction between the sporozoite ligands and host receptors, a systematic screen was performed. The previous Plasmodium falciparum and human surface protein ectodomain libraries were substantially extended, resulting in the creation of new libraries comprising 88 P. falciparum sporozoite protein coding sequences and 182 sequences encoding human hepatocyte surface proteins. Having expressed recombinant proteins from these sequences, a plate-based assay was used, capable of detecting low affinity interactions between recombinant proteins, modified for enhanced throughput, to screen the proteins for interactions. The novel interactions identified in the screen were characterized biochemically, and their essential role in parasite invasion was further elucidated using antibodies and genetically manipulated Plasmodium parasites.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 7540 sporozoite-hepatocyte protein pairs were tested under conditions capable of detecting interactions of at least 1.2 µM K<sub>D</sub>. An interaction between the human fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and the P. falciparum protein Pf34 is identified and reported here, characterizing its affinity and demonstrating the blockade of the interaction by reagents, including a monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, further interactions between Pf34 and a second P. falciparum rhoptry neck protein, PfRON6, and between human low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the P. falciparum protein PIESP15 are identified. Conditional genetic deletion confirmed the essentiality of PfRON6 in the blood-stage, consistent with the important role of this protein in parasite lifecycle. Pf34 was refractory to attempted genetic modification. Antibodies to Pf34 abrogated the interaction and had a modest effect upon sporozoite invasion into primary human hepatocytes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Pf34 and PfRON6 may be members of a functionally important invasion complex which could be a target for future interventions. The modified interaction screening assay, protein expression libraries and P. falciparum mutant parasites reported here may be a useful tool for protein interaction discovery and antigen candidate screening which could be of wider value to the scientific community.","doi":"10.1186/s12936-024-04913-2","publication_date":"2024-05-16T00:00:00","journal_name":"Malaria

minimizing time to clinical trial and first large-scale supply, and maximizing output from the available manufacturing footprint. We describe a rapid virus seed expansion workflow that allows vaccine release to clinical trials within 60 days of antigen sequence identification, followed by vaccine release from globally distributed sites within a further 40 days. We also describe a perfusion-based upstream production process, designed to maximize output while retaining simplicity and suitability for existing manufacturing facilities. This improves upstream volumetric productivity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 by approximately fourfold and remains compatible with the existing downstream process, yielding drug substance sufficient for 10,000 doses from each liter of bioreactor capacity. This accelerated manufacturing process, along with other advantages such as thermal stability, supports the ongoing value of adenovirus-vectored vaccines as a rapidly adaptable and deployable platform for emergency response.","doi":"10.1002/bit.28553","publication_date":"2023-09-25T00:00:00","journal_name":"Biotechnology and bioengineering","journal_issn":"0006-3592","authors":[{"given_name":"Carina C D","family_name":"Joe","full_name":"Joe CCD","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Rameswara R","family_name":"Segireddy","full_name":"Segireddy RR","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0009-0000-3550-1137"}},{"given_name":"Cathy","family_name":"Oliveira","full_name":"Oliveira C","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Adam","family_name":"Berg","full_name":"Berg A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Yuanyuan","family_name":"Li","full_name":"Li Y","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Dimitrios","family_name":"Doultsinos","full_name":"Doultsinos D","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.","Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-0873-9873"}},{"given_name":"Steffi","family_name":"Scholze","full_name":"Scholze S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Goettingen, Germany."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Asma","family_name":"Ahmad","full_name":"Ahmad A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Repligen Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Piergiuseppe","family_name":"Nestola","full_name":"Nestola P","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Goettingen, Germany."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Julia","family_name":"Niemann","full_name":"Niemann J","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Goettingen, Germany."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Alexander D","family_name":"Douglas","full_name":"Douglas AD","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-5410-7562"}}],"full_text_url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/bit.28553","citation_count":2,"keywords":["Adenovirus","Perfusion","Emergency Response","Pandemic Response","Outbreak Response","Viral-vector Vaccine"],"subjects":["Humans","Adenoviridae","Bioreactors","Disease Outbreaks","Adenovirus Vaccines","ChAdOx1 nCoV-19"],"funding_info":[{"name":null,"funder":"Wellcome Trust","grant_number":null},{"name":null,"funder":"Wellcome Trust","grant_number":"220679/Z/20/Z"},{"name":null,"funder":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grant_number":null},{"name":null,"funder":"AstraZeneca","grant_number":null}],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"A screen for Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite surface protein binding to human hepatocyte surface receptors identifies novel host-pathogen interactions","abstract":"Sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes is an essential step in the Plasmodium life-cycle and has similarities, at the cellular level, to merozoite invasion of erythrocytes.

Sporozoites are delimited by a cell membrane that is linked to the underlying acto-myosin molecular motor. While membrane proteins with roles in motility and invasion have been well studied, very little is known about proteins that maintain the sporozoite shape. We demonstrate that in Plasmodium berghei (Pb) a conserved hypothetical gene, PBANKA_1422900 specifies sporozoite structural integrity maintenance protein (SIMP) required for maintaining the sporozoite shape and motility. Sporozoites lacking SIMP exhibited loss of regular shape, extensive membrane blebbing at multiple foci, and membrane detachment. The mutant sporozoites failed to infect hepatocytes, though the altered shape did not affect the organization of cytoskeleton or inner membrane complex (IMC). Interestingly, the components of IMC failed to extend under the membrane blebs likely suggesting that SIMP may assist in anchoring the membrane to IMC. Endogenous C-terminal HA tagging localized SIMP to membrane and revealed the C-terminus of the protein to be extracellular. Since SIMP is highly conserved among Plasmodium species, these findings have important implications for utilizing it as a novel sporozoite-specific vaccine candidate.","doi":"10.1111/mmi.14894","publication_date":"2022-04-08T00:00:00","journal_name":"Molecular microbiology","journal_issn":"0950-382X","authors":[{"given_name":"Dipti","family_name":"Singh","full_name":"Singh D","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Animal Biology, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-7854-0822"}},{"given_name":"Smita","family_name":"Patri","full_name":"Patri S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Animal Biology, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Veeda","family_name":"Narahari","full_name":"Narahari V","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Animal Biology, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Rameswara R","family_name":"Segireddy","full_name":"Segireddy RR","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Animal Biology, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0009-0000-3550-1137"}},{"given_name":"Sandeep","family_name":"Dey","full_name":"Dey S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Animal Biology, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Archi","family_name":"Saurabh","full_name":"Saurabh A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Biotechnology & Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Macha","family_name":"Vijay","full_name":"Vijay M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"N Prakash","family_name":"Prabhu","full_name":"Prabhu NP","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Biotechnology & Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Anand","family_name":"Srivastava","full_name":"Srivastava A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Surendra Kumar","family_name":"Kolli","full_name":"Kolli SK","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Animal Biology, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-6125-0036"}},{"given_name":"Kota Arun","family_name":"Kumar","full_name":"Kumar KA","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Animal Biology, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9451-2917"}}],"full_text_url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14894","citation_count":0,"keywords":["Plasmodium","Sporozoites","Gliding Motility","Inner Membrane Complex"],"subjects":["Hepatocytes","Animals","Mammals","Plasmodium berghei","Sporozoites","Dipeptides","Protozoan Proteins"],"funding_info":[{"name":null,"funder":"Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India","grant_number":"BT/PR2495/BRB/10/950/2011"}],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"Structure of trimeric pre-fusion rabies virus glycoprotein in complex with two protective antibodies.","abstract":"Rabies virus (RABV) causes lethal encephalitis and is responsible for approximately 60,000 deaths per year.

This increased temperature at the tumor microenvironment finally results in tumor cell damage. Nanoparticles play a crucial role in PTT, aiding in the passive and active targeting of the PTA to the tumor microenvironment. Through enhanced permeation and retention effect and surface-engineering, specific targeting could be achieved. This novel delivery tool provides the advantages of changing the shape, size, and surface attributes of the carriers containing PTAs, which might facilitate tumor regression significantly. Further, inclusion of surface engineering of nanoparticles is facilitated through ligating ligands specific to overexpressed receptors on the cancer cell surface. Thus, transforming nanoparticles grants the ability to combine different treatment strategies with PTT to enhance cancer treatment.

In general, OVs have failed to translate the efficacy from bench to bedside. The success of OVs rely on the hypothesis that eliminating CSCs is key to preventing recurrence. However, newly emerging evidence of CSC plasticity challenge this hypothesis by proposing that the CSC pool can be regenerated from non-CSCs post-treatment. We review this evidence surrounding the CSC hypothesis to propose an original perspective on why several advanced OVs may be failing to reflect their true potential in clinical trials.

The human immune system has not previously encountered this virus, raising the important question as to whether or not protective immunity is generated by infection. Growing evidence suggests that protective immunity can indeed be acquired post-infection-although a handful of reinfection cases have been reported. However, it is still unknown whether the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 leads to some degree of long-lasting protection against the disease or the infection. This review draws insights from previous knowledge regarding the nature and longevity of immunity to the related virus, SARS-CoV, to fill the gaps in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Deciphering the immunological characteristics that give rise to protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is critical to guiding vaccine development and also predicting the course of the pandemic.

Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances persist during acute mood episodes of the disorder and during euthymia. However, the treatment potential of hypnotic agents that might be used to manage sleep disturbance in BD is not well understood. Similarly, melatonin and medications with a melatonin-receptor agonist mechanism of action may have chronotherapeutic potential for treating people with the disorder, but the impact of these substances on sleep and circadian rhythms and core symptoms in BD is unclear.<h4>Objective</h4>Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the current evidence for hypnotic and melatonin/melatonin-receptor agonist pharmacotherapy for symptoms of sleep disturbance, mania, and depression in patients with BD.<h4>Methods</h4>AMED, Embase, MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases were searched for studies published in English from the date of inception to 31 October 2021. Studies included in this review were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-controlled/non-randomised studies for BD that examined hypnotic medications selected based on a common pattern of usage for treating insomnia (i.e. chloral, clomethiazole, diphenhydramine, doxepin, doxylamine, promethazine, suvorexant, zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone, and eszopiclone) and melatonin and the melatonin-receptor agonist drugs ramelteon and agomelatine. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB2 and AXIS tools. Pooled effect sizes for RCT outcomes were estimated using random-effects models.<h4>Results</h4>A total of eleven studies (six RCTs and five experimental feasibility studies) involving 1279 participants were included. Each study examined melatonin or melatonin-receptor agonists. No studies of hypnotics were found that fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. Pilot feasibility studies suggested beneficial treatment effects for symptoms of sleep disturbance, depression, and mania. However, the pooled effect of the two available RCT studies assessing sleep quality via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores was not statistically significant (g = - 0.04 [95% CI - 0.81 to 0.73]) and neither was the pooled effect for depressive symptoms (four studies; g = - 0.10 [95% CI - 0.27 to 0.08]). Some RCT evidence suggests ramelteon might prevent relapse into depression in BD. The largest efficacy signal detected was for manic symptoms (four studies; g = - 0.44 [95% CI - 1.03 to 0.14]) but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies and patient characteristics. In the two RCTs assessing manic symptoms during acute mania, adjunctive melatonin demonstrated superior treatment effects versus placebo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a paucity of studies examining pharmacological interventions for sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance in BD. Few studies assessed sleep-related symptoms, and none quantitatively examined endogenous melatonin patterns or other circadian rhythms. Melatonin may be a promising candidate for the adjunctive treatment of bipolar mania. However, dose-finding studies and studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm its efficacy. We recommend parallel monitoring of sleep and circadian rhythms in future trials. Chronobiology-informed trial designs are needed to improve the quality of future studies.<h4>Protocol registration</h4>PROSPERO (CRD42020167528).","doi":"10.1007/s40263-022-00911-7","publication_date":"2022-03-19T00:00:00","journal_name":"CNS drugs","journal_issn":"1172-7047","authors":[{"given_name":"Niall M","family_name":"McGowan","full_name":"McGowan NM","orcid":null,"email":"niall.mcgowan@ndcn.ox.ac.uk","affiliations":["Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. niall.mcgowan@ndcn.ox.ac.uk.","Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. niall.mcgowan@ndcn.ox.ac.uk."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-8183-8558"}},{"given_name":"David S","family_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim DS","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Medical Sciences Division, Clinical Medical School, The John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford Academic Centre, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-4345-661X"}},{"given_name":"Marta","family_name":"de Andres Crespo","full_name":"de Andres Crespo M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Medical Sciences Division, Clinical Medical School, The John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford Academic Centre, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-8035-6175"}},{"given_name":"Lampros","family_name":"Bisdounis","full_name":"Bisdounis L","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.","Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-8815-9486"}},{"given_name":"Simon D","family_name":"Kyle","full_name":"Kyle SD","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9581-5311"}},{"given_name":"Kate E A","family_name":"Saunders","full_name":"Saunders KEA","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.","Warneford Hospital, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-3448-9927"}}],"full_text_url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40263-022-00911-7","citation_count":8,"keywords":[],"subjects":["Humans","Melatonin","Hypnotics and Sedatives","Sleep","Bipolar Disorder","Sleep Wake Disorders","Mania"],"funding_info":[{"name":null,"funder":"National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)","grant_number":null}],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"Infection and mortality of healthcare workers worldwide from COVID-19: a systematic review.","abstract":"<h4>Objectives</h4>To estimate COVID-19 infections and deaths in healthcare workers (HCWs) from a global perspective during the early phases of the pandemic.<h4>Design</h4>Systematic review.<h4>Methods</h4>Two parallel searches of academic bibliographic databases and grey literature were undertaken until 8 May 2020. Governments were also contacted for further information where possible. There were no restrictions on language, information sources used, publication status and types of sources of evidence. The AACODS checklist or the National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools were used to appraise each source of evidence.<h4>Outcome measures</h4>Publication characteristics, country-specific data points, COVID-19-specific data, demographics of affected HCWs and public health measures employed.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 152 888 infections and 1413 deaths were reported. Infections were mainly in women (71.6%, n=14 058) and nurses (38.6%, n=10 706), but deaths were mainly in men (70.8%, n=550) and doctors (51.4%, n=525). Limited data suggested that general practitioners and mental health nurses were the highest risk specialities for deaths. There were 37.2 deaths reported per 100 infections for HCWs aged over 70 years. Europe had the highest absolute numbers of reported infections (119 628) and deaths (712), but the Eastern Mediterranean region had the highest number of reported deaths per 100 infections (5.7).<h4>Conclusions</h4>COVID-19 infections and deaths among HCWs follow that of the general population around the world. The reasons for gender and specialty differences require further exploration, as do the low rates reported in Africa and India. Although physicians working in certain specialities may be considered high risk due to exposure to oronasal secretions, the risk to other specialities must not be underestimated. Elderly HCWs may require assigning to less risky settings such as telemedicine or administrative positions. Our pragmatic approach provides general trends, and highlights the need for universal guidelines for testing and reporting of infections in HCWs.","doi":"10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003097","publication_date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00","journal_name":"BMJ global

clinical and subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections from cross-reactive antiviral responses","abstract":"A major issue in identification of protective T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 lies in distinguishing people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those with cross-reactive immunity generated by exposure to other coronaviruses. We characterised SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses in 168 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects and 118 seronegative subjects without known SARS-CoV-2 exposure using a range of T cell assays that differentially capture immune cell function. Strong ex vivo ELISpot and proliferation responses to multiple antigens (including M, NP and ORF3) were found in those who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 but were rare in pre-pandemic and unexposed seronegative subjects. However, seronegative doctors with high occupational exposure and recent COVID-19 compatible illness showed patterns of T cell responses characteristic of infection, indicating that these readouts are highly sensitive. By contrast, over 90% of convalescent or unexposed people showed proliferation and cellular lactate responses to spike subunits S1/S2, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive T cell populations. The detection of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 is therefore critically dependent on the choice of assay and antigen. Memory responses to specific non-spike proteins provides a method to distinguish recent infection from pre-existing immunity in exposed populations.","doi":"10.1101/2020.09.28.20202929","publication_date":"2020-09-29T00:00:00","journal_name":null,"journal_issn":null,"authors":[{"given_name":"Ane","family_name":"Ogbe","full_name":"Ogbe

Novel infection outcomes can also be shaped by the host microbiota. Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes experimentally colonised by a wild microbiota community and infected by the widespread animal pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, have been shown to suffer higher mortality than those infected by the pathogen alone. Understanding the host responses to such microbiota-pathogen ecological interactions is key to pinpointing the mechanism underlying severe infection outcomes. We conducted transcriptomic analyses of C. elegans colonised by its native microbiota, S. aureus and both in combination. Correlations between altered collagen gene expression and heightened mortality in co-colonised hosts suggest the microbiota modified host resistance to infection. Furthermore, microbiota colonised hosts showed increased expression of immunity genes and variable expression of stress response genes during infection. Changes in host immunity and stress response could encompass both causes and effects of severe infection outcomes. 'Re-wilding' this model nematode host with its native microbiota indicated that typically commensal microbes can mediate molecular changes in the host that are costly when challenged by a novel emerging pathogen.","doi":"10.1111/mec.17586","publication_date":"2024-11-12T00:00:00","journal_name":"Molecular ecology","journal_issn":"0962-1083","authors":[{"given_name":"Ian","family_name":"Will","full_name":"Will I","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-2396-6778"}},{"given_name":"Emily J","family_name":"Stevens","full_name":"Stevens EJ","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.","School of Life Sciences, Keele University, Newcastle-under-Lyme, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-5299-4401"}},{"given_name":"Thomas","family_name":"Belcher","full_name":"Belcher T","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9082-5756"}},{"given_name":"Kayla C","family_name":"King","full_name":"King KC","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.","Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.","Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-1393-9220"}}],"full_text_url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/mec.17586","citation_count":0,"keywords":["Microbiota","Gene Expression","Emerging Disease","Host–pathogen"],"subjects":["Animals","Caenorhabditis elegans","Staphylococcus aureus","Disease Models, Animal","Gene Expression Profiling","Gene Expression","Host-Pathogen Interactions","Stress, Physiological","Transcriptome","Microbiota"],"funding_info":[{"name":null,"funder":"European Research Council","grant_number":"COEVOPRO 802242"},{"name":null,"funder":"European Research Council","grant_number":"802242"}],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"Live attenuated pertussis vaccine for prevention and treatment of allergic airway inflammation in mice.","abstract":"Live attenuated vaccines often have beneficial non-specific effects, protecting against heterologous infectious and non-infectious diseases. We have developed a live attenuated pertussis vaccine, named BPZE1, currently in advanced clinical development. Here, we examined the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of its pertactin-deficient derivative BPZE1P in a mouse model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway inflammation (AAI). BPZE1P was given nasally either before or after sensitization with HDM, followed by HDM challenge, or between two challenge episodes. Vaccination prior to sensitization reduced resistance in the airways, the numbers of infiltrating eosinophils and the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-33, in the lungs but had no effect on Th2 cytokine levels. BPZE1P also protected when delivered after sensitization or between two challenge episodes. However, in this case the levels of Th2 cytokines in the lung were decreased without significant effects on IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-33 production. The vaccine restored lung function and decreased eosinophil influx in the lungs of HDM-treated mice. BPZE1P has a better take than BPZE1 in hosts vaccinated with acellular pertussis vaccines. Therefore, it has interesting potential as a preventive and therapeutic agent against AAI, even in acellular pertussis-vaccinated populations.","doi":"10.1038/s41541-022-00494-w","publication_date":"2022-06-23T00:00:00","journal_name":"NPJ vaccines","journal_issn":"2059-0105","authors":[{"given_name":"Thomas","family_name":"Belcher","full_name":"Belcher T","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Univ.

This has renewed interest in Bordetella pertussis biology and vaccinology. The in vitro growth of B. pertussis has been a source of difficulty, both for the study of the organism and the production of pertussis vaccines. It is inhibited by fatty acids and other hydrophobic molecules. The AcrAB efflux system is present in many different bacteria and in combination with an outer membrane factor exports acriflavine and other small hydrophobic molecules from the cell. Here, we identify that the speciation of B. pertussis has selected for an Acr system that is naturally mutated and displays reduced activity compared to B. bronchiseptica, in which the system appears intact. Replacement of the B. pertussis locus with that of B. bronchiseptica conferred higher levels of resistance to growth inhibition by acriflavine and fatty acids. In addition, we identified that the transcription of the locus is repressed by a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. Palmitate de-represses the expression of the acr locus, dependent on the LysR regulator, strongly suggesting that it is a transcriptional repressor that is regulated by palmitate. It is intriguing that the speciation of B. pertussis has selected for a reduction in activity of the Acr efflux system that typically is regarded as protective to bacteria.","doi":"10.1080/22221751.2019.1601502","publication_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00","journal_name":"Emerging microbes & infections","journal_issn":"2222-1751","authors":[{"given_name":"Iain","family_name":"MacArthur","full_name":"MacArthur I","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["a The Milner Centre for Evolution, University of Bath , Bath , UK.","b Department of Biology and Biochemistry , University of Bath , Bath , UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Thomas","family_name":"Belcher","full_name":"Belcher T","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["b Department of Biology and Biochemistry , University of Bath , Bath , UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9082-5756"}},{"given_name":"Jerry D","family_name":"King","full_name":"King JD","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["b Department of Biology and Biochemistry , University of Bath , Bath , UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Vasantha","family_name":"Ramasamy","full_name":"Ramasamy V","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["b Department of Biology and Biochemistry , University of Bath , Bath , UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Munirah","family_name":"Alhammadi","full_name":"Alhammadi M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["b Department of Biology and Biochemistry , University of Bath , Bath , UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Andrew","family_name":"Preston","full_name":"Preston A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["a The Milner Centre for Evolution, University of Bath , Bath , UK.","b Department of Biology and Biochemistry , University of Bath , Bath , UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-1489-280X"}}],"full_text_url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/22221751.2019.1601502?needAccess=true&","citation_count":5,"keywords":["Evolution","Repressor","growth inhibition","Palmitate"],"subjects":["Bordetella pertussis","Whooping Cough","Acriflavine","Fatty Acids","Bacterial Proteins","Evolution, Molecular","Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial","Mutation","Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"],"funding_info":[{"name":null,"funder":"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","grant_number":"BB/I00713X/2"}],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"A curated genome-scale metabolic model of Bordetella pertussis metabolism.","abstract":"The Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of whooping cough, a serious respiratory infection causing hundreds of thousands of deaths annually worldwide.

Unfortunately, B. pertussis has relatively slow growth in culture, with low biomass yields and variable growth characteristics. B. pertussis also requires a relatively expensive growth medium. We present a new, curated flux balance analysis-based model of B. pertussis metabolism. We enhance the model with an experimentally-determined biomass objective function, and we perform extensive manual curation. We test the model's predictions with a genome-wide screen for essential genes using a transposon-directed insertional sequencing (TraDIS) approach. We test its predictions of growth for different carbon sources in the medium. The model predicts essentiality with an accuracy of 83% and correctly predicts improvements in growth under increased glutamate:fumarate ratios. We provide the model in SBML format, along with gene essentiality predictions.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005639","publication_date":"2017-07-17T00:00:00","journal_name":"PLoS computational biology","journal_issn":"1553-734X","authors":[{"given_name":"Nick","family_name":"Fyson","full_name":"Fyson N","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Mathematics, Imperial College, London, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Jerry","family_name":"King","full_name":"King J","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["The Milner Centre for Evolution and Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Thomas","family_name":"Belcher","full_name":"Belcher T","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["The Milner Centre for Evolution and Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9082-5756"}},{"given_name":"Andrew","family_name":"Preston","full_name":"Preston A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["The Milner Centre for Evolution and Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-1489-280X"}},{"given_name":"Caroline","family_name":"Colijn","full_name":"Colijn C","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Mathematics, Imperial College, London, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-6097-6708"}}],"full_text_url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005639&type=printable","citation_count":6,"keywords":[],"subjects":["Humans","Bordetella pertussis","Whooping Cough","Fumarates","Glutamic Acid","ROC Curve","Genome, Bacterial","Models, Biological","Metabolic Flux Analysis"],"funding_info":[{"name":null,"funder":"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","grant_number":"BBSRC BB/I00713X/2"},{"name":null,"funder":"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","grant_number":"BB/I00713X/2"},{"name":null,"funder":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grant_number":"EP/K026003/1"}],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"Bordetella pertussis evolution in the (functional) genomics era.","abstract":"The incidence of whooping cough caused by Bordetella pertussis in many developed countries has risen dramatically in recent years.

Despite being one of the world's oldest known pathogens, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge surrounding the immunobiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Furthermore, the only licensed vaccine, BCG, is a century old and demonstrates limited efficacy in adults from endemic areas. Despite good global uptake of BCG, tuberculosis (TB) remains a silent epidemic killing 1.4 million in 2019 (WHO, Global tuberculosis report 2020). A mycobacterial CHIM could expedite the development pipeline of novel TB vaccines and provide critical understanding on the immune response to TB. However, developing a CHIM for such a complex organism is a challenging process. The first hurdle to address is which challenge agent to use, as it would not be ethical to use virulent M. tb. This chapter describes the current progress and outstanding issues in the development of a TB CHIM. Previous and current human studies include both aerosol and intradermal models using either BCG or purified protein derivative (PPD) as a surrogate agent.

It would be unethical to deliberately infect humans with virulent <i>Mycobacteria tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb</i>), however surrogate models involving other mycobacteria, <i>M.tb</i> Purified Protein Derivative or genetically modified forms of <i>M.tb</i> either exist or are under development. These utilise varying routes of administration, including <i>via</i> aerosol, per bronchoscope or intradermal injection, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Intranasal CHIMs with SARS-CoV-2 were developed against the backdrop of the evolving Covid-19 pandemic and are currently being utilised to both assess viral kinetics, interrogate the local and systemic immunological responses post exposure, and identify immune correlates of protection. In future it is hoped they can be used to assess new treatments and vaccines. The changing face of the pandemic, including the emergence of new virus variants and increasing levels of vaccination and natural immunity within populations, has provided a unique and complex environment within which to develop a SARS-CoV-2 CHIM. This article will discuss current progress and potential future developments in CHIMs for these two globally significant pathogens.","doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2023.1211388","publication_date":"2023-05-25T00:00:00","journal_name":"Frontiers in immunology","journal_issn":"1664-3224","authors":[{"given_name":"Hazel","family_name":"Morrison","full_name":"Morrison H","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Susan","family_name":"Jackson","full_name":"Jackson S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-0152-3033"}},{"given_name":"Helen","family_name":"McShane","full_name":"McShane H","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-2126-5142"}}],"full_text_url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1211388","citation_count":7,"keywords":["Tuberculosis","Challenge Models","Controlled Human Infection","Chim","Covid-19"],"subjects":["Humans","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Tuberculosis","Pandemics","COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2"],"funding_info":[{"name":null,"funder":"Wellcome Trust","grant_number":"206331/Z/17/Z"}],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"Safety, tolerability, viral kinetics, and immune correlates of protection in healthy, seropositive UK adults inoculated with SARS-CoV-2: a single-centre, open-label, phase 1 controlled human infection study.","abstract":"<h4>Background</h4>A SARS-CoV-2 controlled human infection model (CHIM) has been successfully established in seronegative individuals using a dose of 1×10<sup>1</sup> 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) pre-alpha SARS-CoV-2 virus. Given the increasing prevalence of seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2, a CHIM that could be used for vaccine development will need to induce infection in those with pre-existing immunity. Our aim was to find a dose of pre-alpha SARS-CoV-2 virus that induced infection in previously infected individuals.<h4>Methods</h4>Healthy, UK volunteers aged 18-30 years, with proven (quantitative RT-PCR or lateral flow antigen test) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (with or without vaccination) were inoculated intranasally in a stepwise dose escalation CHIM with either 1×10<sup>1</sup>, 1×10<sup>2</sup>, 1×10³, 1×10<sup>4</sup>, or 1×10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> SARS-CoV-2/human/GBR/484861/2020, the same virus used in the seronegative CHIM. Post-inoculation, volunteers were quarantined in functionally negative pressure rooms (Oxford, UK) for 14 days and until 12-hourly combined oropharyngeal-nasal swabs were negative for viable virus by focus-forming assay. Outpatient follow-up continued for 12 months post-enrolment, with additional visits for those who developed community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary objective was to identify a safe, well tolerated dose that induced infection (defined as two consecutive SARS-CoV-2 positive PCRs starting 24 h after inoculation) in 50% of seropositive volunteers. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04864548); enrolment and follow-up to 12 months post-enrolment are complete.<h4>Findings</h4>Recruitment commenced on May 6, 2021, with the last volunteer enrolled into the dose escalation cohort on Nov 24, 2022. 36 volunteers were enrolled, with four to eight volunteers inoculated in each dosing group from 1×10<sup>1</sup> to 1×10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> SARS-CoV-2. All volunteers have completed quarantine, with follow-up to 12 months complete. Despite dose escalation to 1×10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>, we were unable to induce sustained infection in any volunteers. Five (14%) of 36 volunteers were considered to have transient infection, based on the kinetic of their PCR-positive swabs. Transiently infected volunteers had significantly lower baseline mucosal and systemic SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titres and significantly lower peripheral IFNγ responses against a CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool than uninfected volunteers. 14 (39%) of 36 volunteers subsequently developed breakthrough infection with the omicron variant after discharge from quarantine. Most adverse events reported by volunteers in quarantine were mild, with fatigue (16 [44%]) and stuffy nose (16 [44%]) being the most common. There were no serious adverse events.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Our study demonstrates potent protective immunity induced by homologous vaccination and homologous or heterologous previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The community breakthrough infections seen with the omicron variant supports the use of newer variants to establish a model with sufficient rate of infection for use in vaccine and therapeutic development.<h4>Funding</h4>Wellcome Trust and Department for Health and Social Care.","doi":"10.1016/s2666-5247(24)00025-9","publication_date":"2024-05-01T00:00:00","journal_name":"The Lancet.

It is frequently amplified or overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Owing to alternative splicing, p63 has multiple isoforms called α, β, γ and δ. The regulatory functions of p63 may be isoform-specific. The α isoform inhibits the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and controls apoptosis, while the γ isoform promotes EMT. Here, we observed in TCGA data that a high ratio of the TP63γ isoform to the other isoforms is a pejorative factor for the survival of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We therefore addressed the regulation of the γ isoform. In several tissues (GTEX data), the expression of the RNA-binding protein PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) is negatively correlated with the abundance of TP63γ . Accordingly, we demonstrated that PTBP1 depletion in HNSCC cell lines leads to an increase in abundance of the γ isoform. By RNA immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction assays, we showed that PTBP1 directly binds to TP63 pre-mRNA in close proximity to the TP63γ -specific exon. The region around the TP63γ -specific exon was sufficient to elicit a PTBP1-dependent regulation of alternative splicing in a splice reporter minigene assay. Finally, we demonstrated that the regulation of TP63γ production by PTBP1 is conserved in amphibians, revealing that it encounters a strong evolutionary pressure. Together, these results identify TP63γ as a prognostic marker in HNSCC, and identify PTBP1 as a direct negative regulator of its production.","doi":"10.1101/2021.10.01.462767","publication_date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00","journal_name":null,"journal_issn":null,"authors":[{"given_name":"William","family_name":"Taylor","full_name":"Taylor W","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-9032-847X"}},{"given_name":"David","family_name":"Reboutier","full_name":"Reboutier D","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Luc","family_name":"Paillard","full_name":"Paillard L","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Agnès","family_name":"Méreau","full_name":"Méreau A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Yann","family_name":"Audic","full_name":"Audic Y","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-2498-9792"}}],"full_text_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/10/01/2021.10.01.462767.full.pdf","citation_count":0,"keywords":[],"subjects":[],"funding_info":[],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"The RNA-binding proteins CELF1 and ELAVL1 cooperatively control the alternative splicing of CD44.","abstract":"CD44 mRNA contains nine consecutive cassette exons, v2 to v10.

The identification of PTBP1 as a transacting factor controlling <i>TP63γ</i> production may allow to control <i>TP63γ</i> expression.","doi":"10.1158/2767-9764.crc-22-0350","publication_date":"2022-12-20T00:00:00","journal_name":"Cancer research communications","journal_issn":"2767-9764","authors":[{"given_name":"William","family_name":"Taylor","full_name":"Taylor W","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-9032-847X"}},{"given_name":"Stéphane","family_name":"Deschamps","full_name":"Deschamps S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-6403-235X"}},{"given_name":"David","family_name":"Reboutier","full_name":"Reboutier D","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-2587-1844"}},{"given_name":"Luc","family_name":"Paillard","full_name":"Paillard L","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9290-7616"}},{"given_name":"Agnès","family_name":"Méreau","full_name":"Méreau A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-5603-757X"}},{"given_name":"Yann","family_name":"Audic","full_name":"Audic Y","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Univ Rennes, CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-2498-9792"}}],"full_text_url":"https://aacrjournals.org/cancerrescommun/article-pdf/2/12/1669/3232137/crc-22-0350.pdf","citation_count":2,"keywords":[],"subjects":["Humans","Carcinoma, Squamous Cell","Head and Neck Neoplasms","Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein","Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins","Tumor Suppressor Proteins","Protein Isoforms","Transcription Factors","Alternative Splicing","RNA Splicing Factors","Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck"],"funding_info":[{"name":null,"funder":"Ligue Contre le Cancer","grant_number":"NA"}],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"Inducing Sequential Cycles of Epithelial-Mesenchymal and Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transitions in Mammary Epithelial Cells.","abstract":"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and its reciprocal Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET) occur naturally as a cycling process during embryonic and foetal development.

To explore their functional relationship, we looked for mRNAs that are differentially spliced following the depletion of CELF1, ELAVL1, or both. We found that these proteins control the usage of their target exons in the same direction. Double depletion has a greater effect than individual depletions, showing that CELF1 and ELAVL1 exert additive control. To confirm these results, we carried out RT-PCR on the alternative cassette exons of several mRNAs, including CD44, WNK1, PHACTR2, MICAL3, SPTBN1 , and PPP3CB . Using FRET, we found that CELF1 and ELAVL1 directly interact in cell nuclei. We demonstrated that the combined levels of CELF1 and ELAVL1 are a valuable biomarker in several cancers, even when their individual levels may yield very limited information. CD44 alternative splicing probably accounts in part for the effects of CELF1 and ELAVL1 levels on patient survival. These data point to strong functional interactions between CELF1 and ELAVL1 in the control of mRNA isoform production, resulting in significant impacts on human pathology.","doi":"10.1101/373704","publication_date":"2018-07-20T00:00:00","journal_name":null,"journal_issn":null,"authors":[{"given_name":"Géraldine","family_name":"David","full_name":"David G","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"David","family_name":"Reboutier","full_name":"Reboutier D","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Stéphane","family_name":"Deschamps","full_name":"Deschamps S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Agnès","family_name":"Méreau","full_name":"Méreau A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"William","family_name":"Taylor","full_name":"Taylor W","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-9032-847X"}},{"given_name":"Sergi","family_name":"Padilla-Parra","full_name":"Padilla-Parra S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9290-7616"}},{"given_name":"Marc","family_name":"Tramier","full_name":"Tramier M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-8200-6446"}},{"given_name":"Yann","family_name":"Audic","full_name":"Audic Y","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Luc","family_name":"Paillard","full_name":"Paillard L","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}}],"full_text_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/07/20/373704.full.pdf","citation_count":0,"keywords":[],"subjects":[],"funding_info":[],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"Emulsion and liposome-based adjuvanted R21 vaccine formulations mediate protection against malaria through distinct immune mechanisms.","abstract":"Adjuvanted protein vaccines offer high efficacy, yet most potent adjuvants remain proprietary.

Here, we present the method used for the production of R21, a VLP-based anti-sporozoite malaria vaccine, under current Clinical Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (cGMP). Previous preclinical studies in BALB/c mice showed that R21 produced almost complete protection against sporozoite challenge with transgenic Plasmodium berghei parasites. Here, we have modified the preclinical production process to enable the production of sufficient quantities of highly pure, clinical-grade material for use in human clinical trials. The R21 construct was re-engineered to include a C-tag to allow affinity-based separation from the major contaminant alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX 1, ~74 kDa). To our knowledge, this is the first use of C-tag technology to purify a VLP vaccine candidate for use in human clinical trials. The R21 vaccine has shown high-level efficacy in an African Phase IIb trial, and multiple clinical trials are underway to assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Our findings support the future use of C-tag platform technologies to enable cGMP-compliant biomanufacturing of high purity yeast-expressed VLP-based vaccines for early phase clinical trials when clinical grade material is required in smaller quantities in a quick time frame.","doi":"10.1002/bit.28181","publication_date":"2022-07-22T00:00:00","journal_name":"Biotechnology and

their role in establishment of hepatocyte infection. For preclinical evaluation of immunogenicity of these proteins in mice, chimeric P. berghei sporozoites were created that express the P. falciparum proteins in sporozoites as an additional copy gene under control of the uis4 gene promoter. All fourteen chimeric parasites produced sporozoites but sporozoites of eight lines failed to establish a liver infection, indicating a negative impact of these P. falciparum proteins on sporozoite infectivity. Immunogenicity of the other six proteins (SPELD, ETRAMP10.3, SIAP2, SPATR, HT, RPL3) was analyzed by immunization of inbred BALB/c and outbred CD-1 mice with viral-vectored (ChAd63 or ChAdOx1, MVA) vaccines, followed by challenge with chimeric sporozoites. Protective immunogenicity was determined by analyzing parasite liver load and prepatent period of blood stage infection after challenge. Of the six proteins only SPELD immunized mice showed partial protection. We discuss both the low protective immunogenicity of these proteins in the chimeric rodent malaria challenge model and the negative effect on P. berghei sporozoite infectivity of several P. falciparum proteins expressed in the chimeric sporozoites.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0254498","publication_date":"2021-07-12T00:00:00","journal_name":"PloS one","journal_issn":"1932-6203","authors":[{"given_name":"Surendra Kumar","family_name":"Kolli","full_name":"Kolli SK","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Parasitology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-6125-0036"}},{"given_name":"Ahmed M","family_name":"Salman","full_name":"Salman AM","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Nuffield Department of Medicine, The Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-9259-7339"}},{"given_name":"Jai","family_name":"Ramesar","full_name":"Ramesar J","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Parasitology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Severine","family_name":"Chevalley-Maurel","full_name":"Chevalley-Maurel S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Parasitology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Hans","family_name":"Kroeze","full_name":"Kroeze H","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Parasitology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Fiona G A","family_name":"Geurten","full_name":"Geurten FGA","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Parasitology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Shinya","family_name":"Miyazaki","full_name":"Miyazaki S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Parasitology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Ekta","family_name":"Mukhopadhyay","full_name":"Mukhopadhyay E","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Nuffield Department of Medicine, The Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0002-6045-2522"}},{"given_name":"Catherin","family_name":"Marin-Mogollon","full_name":"Marin-Mogollon C","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Parasitology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Blandine","family_name":"Franke-Fayard","full_name":"Franke-Fayard B","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Parasitology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-6041-4182"}},{"given_name":"Adrian V S","family_name":"Hill","full_name":"Hill AVS","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Nuffield Department of Medicine, The Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Chris J","family_name":"Janse","full_name":"Janse CJ","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Department of Parasitology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}}],"full_text_url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0254498&type=printable","citation_count":2,"keywords":[],"subjects":["Erythrocytes","Animals","Mice, Inbred BALB C","Mice","Plasmodium falciparum","Sporozoites","Malaria, Falciparum","Protozoan Proteins","Malaria Vaccines","Antibodies, Protozoan","Antigens, Protozoan","Female","Ribosomal Protein L3"],"funding_info":[{"name":null,"funder":"H2020 research and innovation program","grant_number":"733273"}],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"Phase 1/2 trial of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with a booster dose induces multifunctional antibody responses.","abstract":"More than 190 vaccines are currently in development to prevent infection by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Animal studies suggest that while neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein may correlate with protection, additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection. Previously, we reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18-55 years ( NCT04324606 ). Now we describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in that trial, who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; n = 20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; n = 32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56 d following prime vaccination. Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; n = 10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; n = 10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose. These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials.","doi":"10.1038/s41591-020-01179-4","publication_date":"2020-12-17T00:00:00","journal_name":"Nature medicine","journal_issn":"1078-8956","authors":[{"given_name":"Jordan R","family_name":"Barrett","full_name":"Barrett JR","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["The Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-0746-1945"}},{"given_name":"Sandra","family_name":"Belij-Rammerstorfer","full_name":"Belij-Rammerstorfer S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["The Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Christina","family_name":"Dold","full_name":"Dold C","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-2314-507X"}},{"given_name":"Katie J","family_name":"Ewer","full_name":"Ewer KJ","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["The Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-9827-9836"}},{"given_name":"Pedro M","family_name":"Folegatti","full_name":"Folegatti PM","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["The Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-5330-0240"}},{"given_name":"Ciaran","family_name":"Gilbride","full_name":"Gilbride C","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["The Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Rachel","family_name":"Halkerston","full_name":"Halkerston R","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Public Health England, Salisbury, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Jennifer","family_name":"Hill","full_name":"Hill J","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":["Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Daniel","family_name":"Jenkin","full_name":"Jenkin D","orcid":null,"email":"Daniel.Jenkin@ndm.ox.ac.uk","affiliations":["The Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence. We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older.<h4>Methods</h4>In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18-55 years, 56-69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups. Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged ≥65 years). First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2·2 × 10<sup>10</sup> virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18-55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56-69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3·5-6·5 × 10<sup>10</sup> virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18-55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA<sub>80</sub>). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137.<h4>Findings</h4>Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18-55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56-69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged ≥56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18-55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56-69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18-55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56-69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 20 713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13 898-33 550], n=39; 56-69 years, 16 170 AU/mL [10 233-40 353], n=26; and ≥70 years 17 561 AU/mL [9705-37 796], n=47; p=0·68). Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA<sub>80</sub> at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 193 [IQR 113-238], n=39; 56-69 years, 144 [119-347], n=20; and ≥70 years, 161 [73-323], n=47; p=0·40). By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (>99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18-55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841-2428], n=24; 56-69 years: 797 SFCs [383-1817], n=29; and ≥70 years: 977 SFCs [458-1914], n=48).<h4>Interpretation</h4>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose. Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities.<h4>Funding</h4>UK Research and Innovation, National Institutes for Health Research (NIHR), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midlands NIHR Clinical Research Network, and AstraZeneca.","doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)32466-1","publication_date":"2020-11-19T00:00:00","journal_name":"Lancet (London, England)","journal_issn":"0140-6736","authors":[{"given_name":"Maheshi N","family_name":"Ramasamy","full_name":"Ramasamy MN","orcid":null,"email":"maheshi.ramasamy@paediatrics.ox.ac.uk","affiliations":["Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

in malaria-endemic areas. To determine its effects on humoral immunity, we conducted a proteomic analysis of polyclonal IgG antibodies directed against the NANP tetrapeptide of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) which comprises the vaccine’s core immunogen. In ten malaria-naïve adult volunteers, R21/Matrix-M induced polarized IgG anti-NANP repertoires, heavily skewed for IGHV3-30/3-33 genes bearing minimal somatic mutation, which remained static in composition following a controlled human malaria infection challenge. Notably, these vaccine-generated antibodies cross-reacted with another protective CSP epitope, the N-terminal junction region, despite its absence from the R21 construct. NANP-specific IGHV3-30/3-33 monoclonal antibodies mined from polyclonal IgG repertoires blocked sporozoite invasion in vitro and prevented parasitemia in vivo . Overall, R21/Matrix-M elicits polarized, minimally mutated, polyclonal IgG responses that can target multiple protective CSP epitopes, offering molecular insight into the serological basis for its demonstrated efficacy against P. falciparum malaria.","doi":"10.1101/2024.10.07.617084","publication_date":"2024-10-11T00:00:00","journal_name":null,"journal_issn":null,"authors":[{"given_name":"Jonathan","family_name":"McDaniel","full_name":"McDaniel JR","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"William","family_name":"Voss","full_name":"Voss WN","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Georgina","family_name":"Bowyer","full_name":"Bowyer G","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Scott","family_name":"Rush","full_name":"Rush SA","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Alexandra","family_name":"Spencer","full_name":"Spencer AJ","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Duncan","family_name":"Bellamy","full_name":"Bellamy D","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-3614-0032"}},{"given_name":"Marta","family_name":"Ulaszewska","full_name":"Ulaszewska M","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Jule","family_name":"Goike","full_name":"Goike J","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Scott","family_name":"Gregory","full_name":"Gregory S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Richter","family_name":"King","full_name":"King CR","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Jason","family_name":"McLellan","full_name":"McLellan JS","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Adrian V.S.","family_name":"Hill","full_name":"Hill AV","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"George","family_name":"Georgiou","full_name":"Georgiou G","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Katie","family_name":"Ewer","full_name":"Ewer KJ","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Gregory","family_name":"Ippolito","full_name":"Ippolito GC","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}}],"full_text_url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.07.617084","citation_count":0,"keywords":[],"subjects":[],"funding_info":[],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]},{"title":"R21 malaria vaccine is protective against intradermal but not intravenous<i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>sporozoites in a randomized controlled human malaria infection study in Kenyan adults","abstract":"Falciparum malaria is a substantial public health problem. Vaccines and monoclonal antibodies targeting the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozoite protein (CSP) are promising control strategies. The protective mechanisms of anti-PfCSP antibodies are incompletely understood, and levels of anti-PfCSP antibodies are inconsistently predictive of protection. We undertook controlled human malaria infections in volunteers vaccinated with the PfCSP-based vaccine R21/Matrix-M, using either intradermal injection (ID) or direct venous inoculation (DVI) of P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ Challenge). R21/Matrix-M was highly protective against intradermal inoculation of PfSPZ Challenge (i.e. 100%, 12 out of 12) but not protective against PfSPZ Challenge by DVI (i.e. 0%, 0 out of 5). These findings imply that the variable delivery of Pf sporozoites into capillaries rather than the subdermal layers by infectious mosquito bites can account for the inconsistent protection provided by

three years follow-up: A phase 1b age de-escalation, dose-escalation trial in adults, children, and infants in Kilifi-Kenya","abstract":"<h4>Background: </h4> Falciparum malaria remains a global health problem. Two vaccines, based on the circumsporozoite antigen, are available.  RTS, S/AS01 was recommended for use in 2021 following the advice of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and WHO Malaria Policy Advisory Group (MPAG). It has since been pre-qualified in 2022 by the WHO. R21 is similar to RTS, S/AS01, and recently licensed in Nigeria, Ghana and Burkina Faso following Phase 3 trial results. <h4>Methods: </h4>: We conducted a Phase 1b age de-escalation, dose escalation bridging study after a change in the manufacturing process for R21. We recruited healthy adults and children and used a three dose primary vaccination series with a booster dose at 1–2 years. Variable doses of R21 and adjuvant (Matrix-M ™) were administered at 10µgR21/50 µg Matrix-M™, 5µgR21/25µg Matrix-M™ and 5µgR21/50µg Matrix-M™ to 20 adults, 20 children, and 51 infants. <h4>Results: </h4>: Self-limiting adverse events were reported relating to the injection site and mild systemic symptoms. Two serious adverse events were reported, neither linked to vaccination. High levels of IgG antibodies to the circumsporozoite antigen were induced, and geometric mean titres in infants, the target group, were 1.1 (0.9 to 1.3) EU/mL at day 0, 10175 (7724 to 13404) EU/mL at day 84 and (following a booster dose at day 421) 6792 (5310 to 8687) EU/mL at day 456. <h4>Conclusions: </h4>: R21/Matrix-M™ is safe, and immunogenic when given at varied doses with the peak immune response seen in infants 28 days after a three dose primary vaccination series given four weeks apart. Antibody responses were restored 28 days after a 4 th dose given one year post a three dose primary series in the young children and infants.

Using trial data, we aimed to estimate the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccine introduction across sub-Saharan Africa.<h4>Methods</h4>We fitted a semi-mechanistic model of the relationship between anti-circumsporozoite protein antibody titres and vaccine efficacy to data from 3 years of follow-up in the phase 2b trial of R21/Matrix-M in Nanoro, Burkina Faso. We validated the model by comparing predicted vaccine efficacy to that observed over 12-18 months in the phase 3 trial. Integrating this framework within a mathematical transmission model, we estimated the cases, malaria deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and cost-effectiveness over a 15-year time horizon across a range of transmission settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Cost-effectiveness was estimated incorporating the cost of vaccine introduction (dose, consumables, and delivery) relative to existing interventions at baseline. We report estimates at a median of 20% parasite prevalence in children aged 2-10 years (PfPR<sub>2-10</sub>) and ranges from 3% to 65% PfPR<sub>2-10</sub>.<h4>Findings</h4>Anti-circumsporozoite protein antibody titres were found to satisfy the criteria for a surrogate of protection for vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria. Age-based implementation of a four-dose regimen of R21/Matrix-M vaccine was estimated to avert 181 825 (range 38 815-333 491) clinical cases per 100 000 fully vaccinated children in perennial settings and 202 017 (29 868-405 702) clinical cases per 100 000 fully vaccinated children in seasonal settings. Similar estimates were obtained for seasonal or hybrid implementation. Under an assumed vaccine dose price of US$3, the incremental cost per clinical case averted was $7 (range 4-48) in perennial settings and $6 (3-63) in seasonal settings and the incremental cost per DALY averted was $34 (29-139) in perennial settings and $30 (22-172) in seasonal settings, with lower cost-effectiveness ratios in settings with higher PfPR<sub>2-10</sub>.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Introduction of the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine could have a substantial public health benefit across sub-Saharan Africa.<h4>Funding</h4>The Wellcome Trust, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the UK Medical Research Council, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership 2 and 3, the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, and the Serum Institute of India, Open Philanthropy.","doi":"10.1016/s1473-3099(23)00816-2","publication_date":"2024-02-08T00:00:00","journal_name":"The Lancet.

malaria","abstract":"<title>Abstract</title>  <p><bold>Background:</bold> The primary immunological readout for clinical vaccine trials of the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine, R21/MatrixM, is total IgG antibody specific to the central four amino acid (NANP) repeat region of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP). A multiplexed Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay, which includes the NANP repeat region of CSP, was developed and validated. <bold>Methods:</bold> Here we describe the validation of a multiplexed MSD assay to measure serum or plasma antibody binding to four antigens: six repeats of the NANP repeat region of P. falciparum (Pf) CSP, the C-terminus (C-term) region of CSP, full length R21 vaccine construct, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Initial assay optimisation, which included validation of the HBsAg international standard, was performed by MSD. Further validation performed in Oxford covered intra and inter-assay, and inter-operator variability, accuracy of QC and standard curve samples, and included bridging between the singleplex ELISA used in previous R21/MM studies, and this multiplexed assay. <bold>Results:</bold> The multiplexed MSD assay was shown to be a robust and specific assay with a broad dynamic range. We report a strong linear relationship between NANP6 IgG as measured by the singleplex ELISA and the multiplexed assay. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This multiplexed MSD assay can be used to measure antibodies specific to the CSP NANP repeat region, CSP C-term region, full length R21 vaccine construct, and HBsAg. This assay can be used to determine humoral immune responses elicited by CSP-containing Pf malaria vaccines.</p>","doi":"10.21203/rs.3.rs-4349515/v1","publication_date":"2024-05-20T00:00:00","journal_name":null,"journal_issn":null,"authors":[{"given_name":"Lisa","family_name":"Stockdale","full_name":"Stockdale L","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"first","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Samuel","family_name":"Provstgaard-Morys","full_name":"Provstgaard-Morys S","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Duncan","family_name":"Bellamy","full_name":"Bellamy D","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-3614-0032"}},{"given_name":"Danielle","family_name":"Woods","full_name":"Woods D","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Katerina","family_name":"Rapi","full_name":"Rapi K","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Amelia","family_name":"Bajer","full_name":"Bajer A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Ben","family_name":"Hollingdale","full_name":"Hollingdale B","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Olivia","family_name":"Munoz","full_name":"Munoz O","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{}},{"given_name":"Adrian","family_name":"Hill","full_name":"Hill A","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0003-0900-9629"}},{"given_name":"Katie","family_name":"Ewer","full_name":"Ewer K","orcid":null,"email":null,"affiliations":[],"role":null,"sequence":"additional","identifiers":{"orcid":"0000-0001-9827-9836"}}],"full_text_url":"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4349515/latest.pdf","citation_count":0,"keywords":[],"subjects":[],"funding_info":[],"organisms":[],"taxids":[]}]
